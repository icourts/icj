<p>The International Court of Justice, 
</p>
<p>Composed as above. 
After deliberation, 
Having regard to Articles 41 and 48 of the Statute of the Court and to 
</p>
<p>Articles 73 and 74 of the Rules of Court, 
</p>
<p>Having regard to the Application by the Federal Republic of Yugo- 
slavia (hereinafter &quot;Yugoslavia&quot;) filed in the Registry of the Court on 
29 April 1999. instituting proceedings against the Kingdom of Spain 
(hereinafter &quot;Spain&quot;) &quot;for violation of the obligation not to use force&quot;, </p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p><b>LEGALITY </b>OF USE OF FORCE (ORDER <i>2 </i>VI 99) 762 
</p>
<p><b><i>Makes </i></b><i>the jbllo~ving <b>Order: 
</b></i></p>
<p>1 .  Whereas in thait Application Yugoslavia defines the subject of the 
dispute as follows: 
</p>
<p>&quot;The subject-inatter of the dispute are acts of the Kingdom of 
Spain by which it has violated its international obligation banning 
the use of force against another State, the obligation not to intervene 
in the interna1 arfairs of another State, the obligation not to violate 
the sovereignty of another State, the obligation to protect the civil- 
ian population and civilian objects in wartime, the obligation to pro- 
tect the environment, the obligation relating to free navigation on 
international rivers, the obligation regarding fundamental human 
rights and freedoms, the obligation not to use prohibited weapons, 
the obligation not to deliberately inflict conditions of life calculated 
to cause the physical destruction of a national group&quot;; 
</p>
<p>2. Whereas in the said Application Yugoslavia refers, as a basis for the juris- 
diction of the Court, to Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the Court 
and to Article <b>IX </b>of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment 
of the Crime of Genocide, adopted by the General Assembly of the United 
Nations on 9 December 1948 (hereinafter the &quot;Genocide Convention&quot;); 
</p>
<p>3. Whereas in its .4pplication Yugoslavia States that the claims sub- 
mitted by it to the Court are based upon the following facts: 
</p>
<p>&quot;The Governrnent of the Kingdom of Spain, together with the 
Governments of other Member States of NATO, took part in the 
acts of use of force against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia by 
taking part in bombing targets in the Federal Republic of Yugosla- 
via. In bombing the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia military and 
civilian targets viere attacked. Great number of people were killed, 
including a great many civilians. Residential houses came under 
attack. Numerous dwellings were destroyed. Enormous damage was 
caused to schoo:ls, hospitals, radio and television stations, cultural 
and health institutions and to places of worship. A large number of 
bridges, roads anid railway lines were destroyed. Attacks on oil refin- 
eries and chemical plants have had serious environmental effects on 
cities, towns and villages in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The 
use of weapons containing depleted uranium is having far-reaching 
consequences for human life. The above-mentioned acts are deliber- 
ately creating coinditions calculated at the physical destruction of an 
ethnie group, in whole or in part. The Government of the Kingdom 
of Spain is taking part in the training, arming, financing, equipping 
and supplying the so-called 'Kosovo Liberation Army'&quot;; </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>and whereas it further states that the said claims are based on the follow- 
ing legal grounds: 
</p>
<p>&quot;The above acts of the Government of the Kingdom of Spain rep- 
resent a gross violation of the obligation not to use force against 
another State. By financing, arming, training and equipping the so- 
called 'Kosovo Liberation Army', support is given to terrorist groups 
and the secessioriist movement in the territory of the Federal Repub- 
lic of Yugoslavia in breach of the obligation not to intervene in the 
interna1 affairs of another State. In addition, the provisions of the 
Geneva Convention of 1949 and of the Additional Protocol No. 1 of 
1977 on the protection of civilians and civilian objects in time of war 
have been v~olated.T he obligation to protect the environment has 
also been breached. The destruction of bridges on the Danube is in 
contravention of the provisions of Article 1 of the 1948 Convention 
on free navigation on the Danube. The provisions of the Interna- 
tional Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and of the Interna- 
tional Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 1966 
have also been breached. Furthermore, the obligation contained in 
the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of 
Genocide not to impose deliberately on a national group conditions 
of life calculated to bring about the physical destruction of the group 
has been breached. Furthermore, the activities in which the King- 
dom of Spain is taking part are contrary to Article 53. paragraph 1 .  
of the Charter of the United Nations&quot;; 
</p>
<p>4. Whereas the claims of Yugoslavia are formulated as follows in the 
Application : 
</p>
<p>&quot;The Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia requests 
the International1 Court of Justice to adjudge and declare: 
</p>
<p>by taking part in the bombing of the territory of the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia, the Kingdom of Spain has acted against 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in breach of its obligation 
not to use force against another State; 
</p>
<p>by taking part in the training, arming, financing, equipping and 
supplying terrorist groups. i.e. the so-called 'Kosovo Liberation 
Army'. the Kingdom of Spain has acted against the Federal 
Republic of 'Yugoslavia in breach of its obligation not to inter- 
vene in the affairs of another State: 
</p>
<p>- by taking pairt in attacks on civilian targets. the Kingdom of 
Spain has acted against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 
breach of its obligation to spare the civilian population, civilians 
and civilian objects; </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>by taking part in destroying or damaging monasteries, monu- 
ments of culture, the Kingdom of Spain has acted against the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in breach of its obligation not to 
commit any act of hostility directed against historical monu- 
ments, works of art or places of worship which constitute cul- 
tural or spiritual heritage of people; 
</p>
<p>by taking part in the use of cluster bombs, the Kingdom of Spain 
has acted against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in breach 
of its obligation not to use prohibited weapons, i.e. weapons cal- 
culated to cause unnecessary suffering; 
</p>
<p>by taking part in the bombing of oil refineries and chemical 
plants, the Kingdom of Spain has acted against the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia in breach of its obligation not to cause 
considerable environmental damage; 
</p>
<p>- by taking part in the use of weapons containing depleted ura- 
nium, the Kingdom of Spain has acted against the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia in breach of its obligation not to use 
prohibited vieapons and not to cause far-reaching health and 
environmental damage; 
</p>
<p>- by taking part in killing civilians, destroying enterprises, commu- 
nications, health and cultural institutions, the Kingdom of Spain 
has acted against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in breach 
of its obligation to respect the right to life, the right to work, the 
right to info'rmation, the right to health care as well as other 
basic human rights: 
</p>
<p>by taking part in destroying bridges on international rivers, the 
Kingdom of Spain has acted against the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia 1111b reach of its obligation to respect freedom of 
navigation on international rivers: 
</p>
<p>- by taking part in activities listed above, and in particular by 
causing enormous environmental damage and by using depleted 
uranium, the Kingdom of Spain has acted against the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia in breach of its obligation not to delib- 
erately inflic~o n a national group conditions of life calculated to 
bring about its physical destruction, in whole or in part; 
</p>
<p>- the Kingdom of Spain is responsible for the violation of the 
above international obligations: 
</p>
<p>- the Kingdoni of Spain is obliged to stop immediately the viola- 
tion of the a.bove obligations vis-&#224;-vis the Federal Republic of 
Y ugoslavia ; 
</p>
<p>- the Kingdom of Spain is obliged to provide compensation for </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>the damage tlone to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and to 
its citizens and juridical persons&quot;; 
</p>
<p>and whereas, at  the end of its Application, Yugoslavia reserves the right 
to amend and supplement it; 
</p>
<p>5. Whereas on 29 April 1999, immediately after filing its Application. 
Yugoslavia also subimitted a request for the indication of provisional 
measures pursuant to Article 73 of the Rules of Court;  and whereas that 
request was accompanied by a volume of photographic annexes pro- 
duced as &quot;evidence&quot; ; 
</p>
<p>6. Whereas, in support of its request for the indication of provisional 
mensures, Yugoslavi;~c ontends <b><i>intcr </i></b><i></i>uliu that, since the onset of the 
bombing of its territory, and as a result thereof, about 1,000 civilians, 
including 19 childreri, have been killed and more than 4,500 have sus- 
tained serious injuries; that the lives of three million children are endan- 
gered; that hundreds of thousands of citizens have been exposed to poi- 
sonous gases; that about one million citizens are short of water supply; 
that about 500,000 v~orkersh ave become jobless: that two million citi- 
zens have no ineans of livelihood and are unable to ensure minimum 
means of sustenance; and that the road and railway network has suffered 
extensive destruction; whereas, in its request for the indication of provi- 
sional measures, Yugoslavia also lists the targets alleged to have come 
under attack in the air strikes and describes in detail the damage alleged 
to have been inflicted upon them (bridges, railway lines and stations, 
roads and means of transport, airports. industry and trade, refineries and 
warehouses storing liquid raw materials and chemicals, agriculture, hos- 
pitals and hcalth care centres, schools, public buildings and housing 
facilities, infrastructure, telecommunications. cultural-historical monu- 
ments and religious shrines); and whereas Yugoslavia concludes from 
this that : 
</p>
<p>&quot;The acts deocribed above caused death, physical and mental 
harm to the poplulation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia; huge 
devastation; heavy pollution of the environment, so that the Yugo- 
slav population is deliberately imposed conditions of life calculated 
to bring about physical destruction of the group, in whole or  in 
part&quot; ; 
</p>
<p>7. Whereas. at  the end of its request for the indication of provisional 
measures. Yugos1avi;i States that 
</p>
<p>&quot;If the proposed measure were not to be adopted, there will be 
new losses of human life, further physical and mental harm inflicted 
on the population of the FR of Yugoslavia, further destruction of 
civilian targets. 'heavy environmental pollution and further physical 
destruction of the people of Yugoslavia&quot;: </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>and whereas, while reserving the right to amend and supplement its 
request, Yugoslavia requests the Court to indicate the following measure: 
</p>
<p>&quot;The Kingdoin of Spain shall cease immediately its acts of use of 
force and shall refrain from any act of threat or use of force against 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia&quot;; 
</p>
<p>8. Whereas the request for the indication of provisional measures was 
accompanied by a letter from the Agent of Yugoslavia, addressed to the 
President and Members of the Court, which read as follows: 
</p>
<p><b>&quot;1 </b>have the honour to bring to the attention of the Court the latest 
bombing of the central area of the town of Surdulica on 27 April 
1999 at noon resulting in losses of lives of civilians, most of whom 
were children and women, and to remind of killings of peoples in 
Kursumlija, Aleksinac and Cuprija, as well as bombing of a refugee 
convoy and the Radio and Television of Serbia, just to mention 
some of the well-known atrocities. Therefore, 1 would like to caution 
the Court that there is a highest probability of further civilian and 
military casualties. 
</p>
<p>Considering the power conferred upon the Court by Article 75. 
paragraph 1,  of the Rules of Court and having in mind the greatest 
urgency caused by the circumstances described in the Requests for 
provisional measure of protection 1 kindly ask the Court to decide 
on the submittecl Requestspvoprio niotu or to fix a date for a hearing 
at earliest possible time&quot;; 
</p>
<p>9. Whereas on 29 April 1999, the day on which the Application and 
the request for the indication of provisional measures were filed in the 
Registry, the Registrar sent to the Spanish Government signed copies of 
the Application and of the request. in accordance with Article 38, para- 
graph 4, and Article '73, paragraph 2, of the Rules of Court;  and whereas 
he also sent to that Government copies of the documents accompanying 
the Application and the request for the indication of provisional meas- 
ures ; 
</p>
<p>10. Whereas on <i>20 </i>April 1999 the Registrar informed the Parties that 
the Court had decided, pursuant to Article 74, paragraph 3, of the Rules 
of Court, t o  hold hea~ringso n 10 and 11 May 1999, where they would be 
able to present their observations on the request for the indication of pro- 
visional measures; 
</p>
<p>11. Whereas, pencling the notification under Article 40, paragraph 3, 
of the Statute and Article 42 of the Rules of Court, by transmittal of the 
printed bilingual tex1 of the Application to the Members of the United 
Nations and other States entitled to appear before the Court, the Regis- 
trar on 29 April 1999 informed those States of the filing of the Applica- 
tion and of its subject-matter, and of the filing of the request for the 
indication of provisional measures ; </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>12. Whereas, since the Court includes upon the bench no judge of 
Yugoslav nationality, the Yugoslav Government has availed itself of the 
provisions of Article 31 of the Statute of the Court to choose Mr. 
Milenko Kreta to sit as judge ad <i>hoc </i>in the case; and whereas no objec- 
tion to that choice wrrs raised within the time-limit fixed for the purpose 
pursuant to Article <i>35 ,  </i>paragraph 3. of the Rules of Court;  whereas, 
since the Court includes upon the bench no judge of Spanish nationality, 
the Spanish Governtrient has availed itself of the provisions of Article 31 
of the Statute of the Court to choose Mr. Santiago Torres Bernardez to 
sit as judge a d  <i>hoc </i>in the case; whereas, within the time-limit fixed for the 
purpose pursuant to Article 35, paragraph 3, of the Rules of Court, 
Yugoslavia, referring to Article 3 1 ,  paragraph <i>5.  </i>of the Statute, objected 
to that choice; and whereas the Court, after due deliberation, found that 
the nomination of a judge a d  <i>hoc </i>by Spain was justified in the present 
phase of the case; 
</p>
<p>13. Whereas, at thr: public hearings held between 10 and 12 May 1999, 
oral observations on the request for the indication of provisional meas- 
ures were presented by the following: 
</p>
<p>Mr. Rodoljub Etinski, Agent. 
Mr. Ian Brownlie, 
Mr. Paul J .  <b>1. </b>M. de Waart. 
Mr. Eric Suy, 
Mr. Miodrag Mitii:, 
Mr. Olivier Corten; 
</p>
<p>011 helzalf' <i>of </i>Spain 
</p>
<p>Mr. Aurelio P&#233;rez Giralda, Agerzf; 
</p>
<p>14. Whereas, in this phase of the proceedings, the Parties presented the 
following submissions : 
</p>
<p>011 hehlrlf of Yugoslavia 
</p>
<p>&quot;[Tlhe Court [is asked] to indicate the following provisional 
measure : 
</p>
<p>[Tlhe Kingdorn of Spain shall cease immediately the acts of use of 
force and shall refrain from any act of threat or  use of force against 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia&quot;; 
</p>
<p>On <i>hrhuij <b>q/ '</b></i>S<b><i> </i></b><i></i>pain. 
</p>
<p>&quot;The Kingdorn of Spain respectfully requests the Court to:  
1. Declare that it has no jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the 
</p>
<p>Application filedl by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia; 
2. Reject the request of the Government of the Federal Republic </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>of Yugoslavia with a view to  the indication of provisional measures 
in relation to the: Kingdom of Spain; 
</p>
<p>3. Decide to remove this case from the General List of the Court&quot; : 
</p>
<p>15. Whereas the C'ourt is deeply concerned with the human tragedy, 
the loss of life, and the enormous suffering in Kosovo which form the 
background of the p:resent dispute, and with the continuing loss of life 
and human suffering in al1 parts of Yugoslavia; 
</p>
<p>16. Whereas the Court is profoundly concerned with the use of force 
in Yugoslavia; whereas under the present circumstances such use raises 
very serious issues of international law; 
</p>
<p>17. Whereas the Court is mindful of the purposes and principles of the 
United Nations Charter and of its own responsibilities in the mainte- 
nance of peace and security under the Charter and the Statute of the 
Court; 
</p>
<p>18. Whereas the Court deems it necessary to emphasize that al1 parties 
appearing before it must act in conformity with their obligations under 
the United Nations Charter and other rules of international law, includ- 
ing humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p>19. Whereas the Court, under its Statute, does not automatically have 
jurisdiction over legal disputes between States parties to that Statute or 
between other States to whom access to the Court has been granted; 
whereas the Court has repeatedly stated &quot;that one of the fundamental 
principles of its Statuite is that it cannot decide a dispute between States 
witliout the consent of those States to its jurisdiction&quot; <i>(Eust Tin~or( Por- 
tugul </i>V. <i>Au~/ru l iu )J,u dgment, <b></b></i><b>1. </b><i>C. J.  Reports 199.5, </i>p. 101, para. 26); and 
whereas the Court can therefore exercise jurisdiction only between States 
parties to a dispute who not only have access to the Court but also have 
accepted the jurisdiction of the Court, either in general form or for the 
individual dispute concerned; 
</p>
<p>20. Whereas on a request for provisional measures the Court need not, 
before deciding whether or not to indicate them, finally satisfy itself that 
it has jurisdiction on the merits of the case, yet it ought not to indicate 
such measures unlesri the provisions invoked by the applicant appear, 
prima facie, to afford a basis on which the jurisdiction of the Court might 
be established; 
</p>
<p>21. Whereas in its Application Yugoslavia claims, in the first place, to 
found the jurisdiction of the Court upon Article 36, paragraph 2, of the </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Statute; whereas each of the two Parties has made a declaration recog- 
nizing the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court pursuant to that provi- 
sion; whereas Yugoslavia's declaration was deposited with the Secretary- 
General of the United Nations on 26 April 1999, and that of Spain on 
29 October 1990; 
</p>
<p>22. Whereas Yugoslavia's declaration is formulated as follows : 
</p>
<p>&quot;1 hereby declare that the Government of the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia recognizes, in accordance with Article 36. paragraph 2, 
of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, as compulsory 
<i>ip.vo ,fucto </i>and without special agreement. in relation to any other 
State accepting the same obligation, that is on condition of recipro- 
city, the jurisdiction of the said Court in ail disputes arising or  which 
may arise after the signature of the present Declaration, with regard 
to the situations or  facts subsequent to this signature, except in cases 
where the parties have agreed or  shall agree to have recourse to 
another procedure or  to another method of pacific settlement. The 
present Declaration does not apply to disputes relating to questions 
which, under intlrrnational law. fall exclusively within the jurisdic- 
tion of lhe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. as well as to territorial 
disputes. 
</p>
<p>The aforesaid obligation is accepted until such time as notice may 
be given to terminate the acceptance&quot;; 
</p>
<p>and whereas the declaration of Spain reads as follows: 
</p>
<p>&quot;1. On behalf of the Spanish Government, 1 have the honour to 
declare that the Kingdom of Spain accepts as compulsory <i>ipso fucto 
</i>and without special agreement, the jurisdiction of the International 
Court of Justice, in conformity with Article 36, paragraph 2, of the 
Statute of the Court, in relation to any other State accepting the 
samc obligation, on condition of reciprocity, in legal disputes not 
included among the following situations and exceptions: 
</p>
<p><i>i u )  </i>disputes in regard to which the Kingdom of Spain and the 
other party or parties have agreed or shall agree to have recourse 
to some oth~erm ethod of peaceful settlement of the dispute; 
</p>
<p><i>( h l  </i>disputes in regard to whlch the other party or  parties have 
accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court only in rela- 
tion to or for the purposes of the dispute in question; 
</p>
<p>(c)  disputes in regard to which the other party or  parties have 
accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court less than 
12 months prior to the filing of the application bringing the 
dispute before the Court;  
</p>
<p>( d )  disputes arising prior to the date on which this Declaration was 
deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations or  </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>relating to !:vents or situations which occurred prior to that 
date, even if such events or situations may continue to occur or 
to have effects thereafter. 
</p>
<p>2. The Kingdcim of Spain may at any time, by means of a notifi- 
cation addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, 
add to, amend or withdraw, in whole or in part, the foregoing res- 
ervations or any that may hereafter be added. These amendments 
shall become effective on the date of their receipt by the Secretary- 
General of the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>3. The present Declaration, which is deposited with the Secretary- 
General of the United Nations in conformity with Article 36, para- 
graph 4, of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, shall 
remain in force until such time as it has been withdrawn by the 
Spanish Governrnent or superseded by another declaration by the 
latter. 
</p>
<p>The withdrawal of the Declaration shall become effective after a 
period of six months has elapsed from the date of receipt by the 
Secretary-Genera~lo f the United Nations of the relevant notification 
by the Spanish (Jovernment. However, in respect of States which 
have established a period of less than six months between notifica- 
tion of the withdlrawal of their Declaration and its becoming effec- 
tive, the withdrawal of the Spanish Declaration shall become effec- 
tive after such sh~orterp eriod has elapsed&quot;; 
</p>
<p>23. Whereas Spain contends that the Court's jurisdiction cannot be 
founded upon Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the Court in this 
case, in view of the reservations contained in its declaration; whereas 
it observes in particiilar that, under the terms of paragraph <b>1 </b>(c) of 
that declaration, it does not recognize the jurisdiction of the Court in 
respect of 
</p>
<p>&quot; ( c )  disputes in regard to which the other party or parties have 
accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court less than 
12 months prior to the filing of the application bringing the 
dispute before the Court&quot;; 
</p>
<p>whereas Spain argues that &quot;this limitation is both specific and unequivo- 
cal and should not be a matter for either interpretation or doubt&quot; and 
that &quot;the intention of Spain in formulating its declaration could not have 
been clearer&quot;; and whereas it points out that 12 months have manifestly 
not elapsed between i.he date on which Yugoslavia accepted the jurisdic- 
tion of the Court and that on which it filed its Application; 
</p>
<p>24. Whereas Yugoslavia submitted no argument on this point; 
</p>
<p>25. Whereas, given that Yugoslavia deposited its declaration of accept- 
ance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court with the Secretary- </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>General on 26 April 1099 and filed its Application instituting proceedings 
with the Court on 29 April 1999, there can be no doubt that the condi- 
tions for the exclusiori of the Court's jurisdiction provided for in para- 
graph 1 <i>( c )  </i>of Spain's declaration are satisfied in this case; whereas, as 
the Court recalled in its Judgment of 4 December 1998 in the <i>Fisheries 
Jurisdict io (Spain </i>v. <i>Cunada) </i>case, 
</p>
<p>&quot;It is for each State, in formulating its declaration, to decide upon 
the limits it places upon its acceptance of the jurisdiction of the 
Court: '[tlhis jurisdiction only exists within the limits within which it 
has been accepted' <i>(Phosphates in Morocco, Judgment, 1938, 
P. C.1. J.,  Series AIB, No. 74, </i>p. 23)&quot; <i>(1. <b></b></i><b>C1 </b><i>J. Reports 1998, </i>p. 453, 
para. 44);  
</p>
<p>and whereas, as the Court noted in its Judgment of 11 June 1998 in the 
case concerning the <i>Idand und Maritime Boundury het~tleenC ameroon 
and Nigeria (Curneroon </i>v. <i>Nigeriu), </i>&quot;[als early as 1952, it held in the case 
concerning <i>Anglo-lruiziun Oil Co. </i>that . . . 'jurisdiction is conferred on 
the Court only to the extent to which the [declarations made] coincide in 
conferring it' (I.C . <i>J. I;!eports 1952, </i>p. 103)&quot; <b>(1.</b><i>C<b></b></i><b> </b><i>.J . Reports 1998, </i>p. 298, 
para. 43); and whereas the declarations made by the Parties under 
Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute manifestly cannot constitute a 
basis of jurisdiction i n  the present case, even prima facie; 
</p>
<p>26. Whereas, referring to United Nations Security Council resolution 
777 (1992) of 19 September 1992 and to United Nations General Assem- 
bly resolution 4711 of 22 September 1992, Spain also contends that &quot;the 
Federal Rep~iblico f Yugoslavia cannot be considered, as it claims, to be 
the continuator State of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugo- 
slavia&quot;, and that, not having duly acceded to the Organization, it is not a 
Menlber thereof, is not a party to the Statute of the Court and cannot 
appear before the latter; 
</p>
<p>27. Whereas Yugoslavia, referring to the position of the Secretariat, as 
expressed in a letter dated 29 September 1992 from the Legal Counsel of 
the Organization (doc. Al471485), and to the latter's subsequent practice, 
contends for its part that General Assembly resolution 4711 &quot;[neither] ter- 
minate[d] nor suspencd[ed] Yugoslavia's membership in the Organiza- 
tion&quot;, and that the said resolution did not take away from Yugoslavia 
&quot;[its] right to participate in the work of organs other than Assembly 
bodies&quot; ; 
</p>
<p>28. Whereas, in view of its finding in paragraph 25 above, the Court 
need not consider thi:; question for the purpose of deciding whether or 
not it can indicate provisional measures in the present case; </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>29. Whereas in its Application Yugoslavia claims, in the second place, 
to found the jurisdiction of the Court on Article IX of the Genocide Con- 
vention, which providizs: 
</p>
<p>&quot;Disputes between the Contracting Parties relating to the interpre- 
tation, application or  fulfilment of the present Convention, including 
those relating to the responsibility of a State for genocide or  for any 
of the other acts enumerated in article III, shall be submitted to the 
International Court of Justice at the request of any of the parties to 
the dispute&quot; ; 
</p>
<p>whereas it is not disputed that both Yugoslavia and Spain are parties to 
the Genocide Convention; whereas, however, Spain's instrument of acces- 
sion to the Convention, deposited with the Secretary-General on 13 Sep- 
tember 1968, contairis a reservation &quot;in respect of the whole of 
Article IX&quot;; 
</p>
<p>30. Whereas Spain contends that, this reservation having given rise to 
no objection by Yugoislavia, Article IX of the Genocide Convention &quot;is 
inapplicable to the mutual relations between Spain and . . . Yugoslavia&quot;, 
and that the said Article cannot accordingly found the jurisdiction of the 
Court in this case, eveii prima facie; and whereas Spain further contends 
that the dispute submitted to  the Court by Yugoslavia &quot;does not . . . 
come within the scope of the Convention&quot;; 
</p>
<p>3 1. Whereas Yugos:lavia disputed Spain's interpretation of the Geno- 
cide Convention, but submitted no argument concerning Spain's reserva- 
tion to Article IX of tlne Convention; 
</p>
<p>32. Whereas the Genocide Convention does not prohibit reservations; 
whereas Yugoslavia did not object to Spain's reservation to Article IX: 
and whereas the said reservation had the effect of excluding that Ar- 
ticle from the provisioins of the Convention in force between the Parties: 
</p>
<p>33. Whereas in consequence Article IX of the Genocide Convention 
cannot found the jurisdiction of the Court to entertain a dispute between 
Yugoslavia and Spain alleged to faIl within its provisions; and whereas 
that Article manifestly does not constitute a basis of jurisdiction in the 
present case, even prima facie: 
</p>
<p>34. Whereas Spain l&#249;rther states that it &quot;does not accept the jurisdic- 
tion of the Court under Article 38, paragraph <i>5 ,  </i>of the Rules of Court&quot;; 
whereas that provision reads as follows : 
</p>
<p><i>&quot; 5 .  </i>When the applicant State proposes to found the jurisdiction 
of the Court upoii a consent thereto yet to be given or manifested 
by the State against which such application is made, the application 
shall be transmitted to that State. It shall not however be entered in </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>the General List, nor any action be taken in the proceedings, unless 
and until the State against which such application is made consents 
to the Clourt's jurisdiction for the purposes of the case&quot;; 
</p>
<p>and whereas it is quite clear that, in the absence of consent by Spain, 
given pursuant to Article 38, paragraph 5, of the Rules, the Court cannot 
exercise jurisdiction in the present case, even prima facie; 
</p>
<p><i>35. </i>Whereas it follows from what has been said above that the Court 
manifestly lacks jurisdiction to entertain Yugoslavia's Application; 
whereas it cannot therefore indicate any provisional measure whatsoever 
in order to protect the rights invoked therein; and whereas, within a sys- 
tem of consensual jurisdiction, to maintain on the General List a case 
upon which it appears certain that the Court will not be able to adjudi- 
cate on the merits would most assuredly not contribute to the sound 
administration of justice; 
</p>
<p>36. Whereas there is a fundamental distinction between the question 
of the acceptance by ;iS tate of the Court's jurisdiction and the compati- 
bility of particular acts with international law: the former requires con- 
sent; the latter question can only be reached when the Court deals with 
the merits alter havinig established its jurisdiction and having heard full 
legal arguments by bot11 parties; 
</p>
<p>37. Whereas. whether or not States accept the jurisdiction of the 
Court, they remain in any event responsible for acts attributable to them 
that violate international law, including humanitarian law; whereas any 
disputes relating to the legality of such acts are required to be resolved 
by peaceful means, the choice of which. pursuant to Article 33 of the 
Charter, is left to the parties; 
</p>
<p><i>35. </i>Whereas in this context the parties should take care not to aggra- 
vate or  extend the dispute; 
</p>
<p>39. Whereas. when such a dispute gives rise to a threat to the peace, 
bre~icho f the peace or  act of aggression. the Security Council has special 
responsibilities under Chapter VI1 of the Charter; 
</p>
<p>40. For these reasons,
