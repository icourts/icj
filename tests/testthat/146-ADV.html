activities&#8221; &#8212; <i>The Court has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion.  
</i></p>
<p><i>Scope of jurisdiction of the Court.
Binding character attributed to opinion of the Court</i> <i>by ILOAT Statute does not 
</i></p>
<p><i>affect the way in which the Court functions</i> &#8212; <i>Power of the Court to review a 
judgment of ILOAT limited to two grounds : that Tribunal wrongly confirmed its 
jurisdiction or that decision is vitiated by fundamental fault in procedure fol-
lowed</i> &#8212; <i>The Court&#8217;s review not in the nature of an appeal on merits of judgment.

</p>
<p><i>Discretion of the Court to decide whether it should give an opinion.
The Court as principal organ of the United Nations and as judicial body</i> &#8212; <i>The

review of judgments of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal</i> &#8212; <i>Relevant

of the parties in investment disputes</i> &#8212; <i>Requirements of good administration of

<p><i>Inequality in proceedings before the Court has been substantially alleviated by

ment setting forth the views of Ms Saez Garc&#237;a and, on the other hand, not to hold 
oral proceedings.

<p>In the matter of Judgment No. 2867 of the Administrative Tribunal of the 
International Labour Organization upon a complaint filed against the Interna-
tional Fund for Agricultural Development,
</p>
<p>The Court,
</p>
<p>composed as above,
</p>
<p><i>gives the following Advisory Opinion :
</i></p>
<p>1. By a letter dated 23 April 2010, which reached the Registry on 
26 April 2010, the President of the International Fund for Agricultural Develop-
ment (hereinafter &#8220;IFAD&#8221; or the &#8220;Fund&#8221;) informed the Court that the Execu-
tive Board of IFAD, acting within the framework of Article XII of the Annex 
to the Statute of the Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Orga-
nization (hereinafter the &#8220;ILOAT&#8221; or the &#8220;Tribunal&#8221;), had decided to challenge

</p>
<p>the decision rendered by the Tribunal on 3 February 2010 in Judgment No. 2867, 
and to refer the question of the validity of that Judgment to the Court. Certified 
true copies of the English and French versions of the resolution adopted by the 
Executive Board of IFAD for that purpose at its ninety-ninth session, on 
22 April 2010, were enclosed with the letter. The resolution reads as follows :
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>The Executive Board of the International Fund for Agricultural Develop-
ment, at its ninety-ninth session held on 21-22 April 2010 :
</i></p>
<p><i>Whereas</i>, by its Judgment No. 2867 of 3 February 2010, the Administra-
tive Tribunal of the International Labour Organization (ILOAT) confirmed 
its jurisdiction in the complaint introduced by Ms A. T. S. G. against the 
International Fund for Agricultural Development,
</p>
<p><i>Whereas</i> Article XII of the Annex [to] the Statute of the Administrative 
Tribunal of the International Labour Organization provides as follows :
</p>
<p>&#8216;1. In any case in which the Executive Board of an international 
organization which has made the declaration specified in Article II, 
paragraph 5, of the Statute of the Tribunal challenges a decision of the 
Tribunal confirming its jurisdiction, or considers that a decision of the 
Tribunal is vitiated by a fundamental fault in the procedure followed, 
the question of the validity of the decision given by the Tribunal shall 
be submitted by the Executive Board concerned, for an advisory opi-
nion, to the International Court of Justice.
</p>
<p>2. The opinion given by the Court shall be binding.&#8217; 1,
<i>Whereas</i> the Executive Board, after consideration, wishes to avail itself 
</p>
<p>of the provisions of the said Article,
<i>Decides</i> to submit the following legal questions to the International Court 
</p>
<p>of Justice for an advisory opinion :
 &#8216;I. Was the ILOAT competent, under Article II of its Statute, to hear the 
</p>
<p>complaint introduced against the International Fund for Agricultural 
Development (hereby the Fund) on 8 July 2008 by Ms A. T. S. G., an 
individual who was a member of the staff of the Global Mechanism of 
the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those 
Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Par-
ticularly in Africa (hereby the Convention) for which the Fund acts 
merely as housing organization ?  
</p>
<p> II. Given that the record shows that the parties to the dispute underlying 
the ILOAT&#8217;s Judgment No. 2867 were in agreement that the Fund and 
</p>
<p> 1 Note of the Court : According to the preamble of the Annex to the Statute of the 
ILOAT, that Statute &#8220;applies in its entirety to . . . international organizations [having 
made the declaration specified in Article II, paragraph 5, of the Statute of the Tribunal] 
subject to . . . provisions which, in cases affecting any one of these organizations, are appli-
cable as [set out in this Annex]&#8221;. With respect to Article XII of the Statute, it should be 
noted that only its first paragraph is modified by the Annex. Its second paragraph is not set 
out in the Annex and thus remains unchanged as applicable to those organizations. In this 
regard, the text of Article XII of the Annex to the Statute quoted by IFAD contains both 
paragraphs. When the Court in the present Advisory Opinion refers to Article XII of the 
Annex to the Statute of the ILOAT, it is understood that this includes both the modified 
paragraph 1 and the original paragraph 2 of Article XII of the Statute.

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>16  judgment no. 2867 of the ilo (advisory opinion)
</p>
<p>the Global Mechanism are separate legal entities and that the Com-
plainant was a member of the staff of the Global Mechanism, and con-
sidering all the relevant documents, rules and principles, was the 
ILOAT&#8217;s statement, made in support of its decision confirming its juris-
diction, that &#8216;the Global Mechanism is to be assimilated to the various 
administrative units of the Fund for all administrative purposes&#8217; and 
that the &#8216;effect of this is that administrative decisions taken by the Man-
aging Director in relation to staff in the Global Mechanism are, in law, 
decisions of the Fund&#8217; outside its jurisdiction and/or did it constitute a 
fundamental fault in the procedure followed by the ILOAT ?
</p>
<p> III. Was the ILOAT&#8217;s general statement, made in support of its decision 
confirming its jurisdiction, that &#8216;the personnel of the Global Mechanism 
are staff members of the Fund&#8217; outside its jurisdiction and/or did it 
constitute a fundamental fault in the procedure followed by the ILOAT ?
 
</p>
<p> IV. Was the ILOAT&#8217;s decision confirming its jurisdiction to entertain the 
Complainant&#8217;s plea alleging an abuse of authority by the Global Mecha-
nism&#8217;s Managing Director outside its jurisdiction and/or did it consti-
tute a fundamental fault in the procedure followed by the ILOAT ?  
</p>
<p> V. Was the ILOAT&#8217;s decision confirming its jurisdiction to entertain the 
Complainant&#8217;s plea that the Managing Director&#8217;s decision not to renew 
the Complainant&#8217;s contract constituted an error of law outside its juris-
diction and/or did it constitute a fundamental fault in the procedure 
followed by the ILOAT ?
</p>
<p> VI. Was the ILOAT&#8217;s decision confirming its jurisdiction to interpret the 
Memorandum of Understanding between the Conference of the Parties 
to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those 
Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Par-
ticularly in Africa and IFAD (hereby the MoU), the Convention, and 
the Agreement Establishing IFAD beyond its jurisdiction and/or did it 
constitute a fundamental fault in the procedure followed by the ILOAT ?
 
</p>
<p> VII. Was the ILOAT&#8217;s decision confirming its jurisdiction to determine that 
by discharging an intermediary and supporting role under the MoU, 
the President was acting on behalf of IFAD outside its jurisdiction and/
or did it constitute a fundamental fault in the procedure followed by 
the ILOAT ?
</p>
<p> VIII. Was the ILOAT&#8217;s decision confirming its jurisdiction to substitute the 
discretionary decision of the Managing Director of the Global Mecha-
nism with its own outside its jurisdiction and/or did it constitute a fun-
damental fault in the procedure followed by the ILOAT ?
</p>
<p> IX. What is the validity of the decision given by the ILOAT in its Judgment 
No. 2867 ?&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>2. On 26 April 2010, in accordance with Article 66, paragraph 1, of the Stat-
ute of the Court, notice of the request for an advisory opinion was given to all 
States entitled to appear before the Court.
</p>
<p>10</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>17  judgment no. 2867 of the ilo (advisory opinion)
</p>
<p>3. By an Order dated 29 April 2010, in accordance with Article 66, para-
graph 2, of its Statute, the Court decided that IFAD and its member States 
entitled to appear before the Court, the States parties to the United Nations 
Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious 
Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa (hereinafter the 
&#8220;UNCCD&#8221; or the &#8220;Convention&#8221;) entitled to appear before the Court and those 
specialized agencies of the United Nations which had made a declaration recog-
nizing the jurisdiction of the ILOAT pursuant to Article II, paragraph 5, of the 
Statute of the Tribunal were likely to be able to furnish information on the ques-
tions submitted to the Court for an advisory opinion. By that same Order, the 
Court fixed, respectively, 29 October 2010 as the time-limit within which written 
statements might be presented to it on the questions, and 31 January 2011 as the 
time-limit within which States and organizations having presented written state-
ments might submit written comments on the other written statements, in accor-
dance with Article 66, paragraph 4, of the Statute of the Court.
</p>
<p>The Court also decided that the President of IFAD should transmit to the 
Court, within the same time-limits, any statement setting forth the views of 
Ms Ana Teresa Saez Garc&#237;a, the Complainant in the proceedings against the Fund 
before the ILOAT, which she might wish to bring to the attention of the Court, as 
well as any possible comments she might have on the other written statements.
</p>
<p>4. By letters dated 3 May 2010, pursuant to Article 66, paragraph 2, of the 
Statute of the Court, the Registrar notified the above-mentioned States and orga-
nizations of the Court&#8217;s decisions and transmitted to them a copy of the Order.
</p>
<p>5. Pursuant to Article 65, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the Court, IFAD 
communicated to the Court a dossier of documents likely to throw light upon 
the questions ; these documents reached the Registry on 2 August 2010. The 
dossier was subsequently placed on the Court&#8217;s website.
</p>
<p>6. Within the time-limit fixed by the Court for that purpose, written state-
ments were presented, in order of their receipt, by IFAD and by the Plurina-
tional State of Bolivia. Also within that time-limit, the General Counsel of 
IFAD transmitted a statement setting forth the views of Ms Saez Garc&#237;a. On 
1 November 2010, the Registrar communicated to IFAD a copy of the written 
statement of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, a second copy of which was 
included to be provided to Ms Saez Garc&#237;a. On the same date, the Registrar 
communicated to the Plurinational State of Bolivia copies of the written state-
ment of IFAD and of the statement of Ms Saez Garc&#237;a.
</p>
<p>7. By a letter dated 21 January 2011 and received in the Registry on the same 
day, the General Counsel of IFAD, referring to forthcoming consultations 
between the Fund and the Bureau of the Conference of the Parties of the 
UNCCD (hereinafter the &#8220;COP&#8221;) relating to the very subject-matter of the pro-
ceedings before the Court, requested that the time-limit for the submission of 
written comments be extended, in order that comments on behalf of the Fund 
might be submitted &#8220;immediately following such consultations and after the 
thirty-fourth session of the IFAD Governing Council . . . and the first session of 
the Consultation for the Ninth Replenishment of the Resources of the 
Fund . . .&#8221;. Accordingly, the President of the Court, by Order of 24 Janu-
ary 2011, extended to 11 March 2011 the time-limit within which written com-
ments might be submitted on the other written statements, in accordance with 
Article 66, paragraph 4, of the Statute of the Court, and within which any pos-
sible comments by Ms Saez Garc&#237;a might be presented to the Court. 
</p>
<p>8. Within the time-limit so extended, the General Counsel of IFAD communi-
cated to the Court the written comments of IFAD and transmitted to the Court 
</p>
<p>11</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>18  judgment no. 2867 of the ilo (advisory opinion)
</p>
<p>the comments of Ms Saez Garc&#237;a. In the letter dated 9 March 2011 accompany-
ing the first of these documents, the General Counsel also requested that the 
Court make the written statements and comments accessible to the public, that 
the Court seek the views of the COP and that the Court hold oral proceedings.
</p>
<p>On 14 March 2011, the Registrar transmitted to the Plurinational State of 
Bolivia a copy of the written comments of IFAD and of Ms Saez Garc&#237;a.
</p>
<p>9. In a letter dated 24 March 2011 addressed to the Registrar, the counsel for 
Ms Saez Garc&#237;a stated, with respect to the requests made by the General Counsel 
of IFAD in his above-mentioned letter dated 9 March 2011 (see paragraph 8), 
that his client had no objection to the Court making the written statements and 
comments accessible to the public, but that she wished to express her disagree-
ment with the other two requests expressed by the General Counsel in that letter.
</p>
<p>10. By a letter dated 30 March 2011, the Registrar informed counsel for 
Ms Saez Garc&#237;a that, in proceedings concerning the review of judgments of 
administrative tribunals, it was not possible for the complainant before such a 
tribunal to address directly to the Court communications for its consideration, 
and that any communication coming from Ms Saez Garc&#237;a in the case should be 
transmitted to the Court through IFAD.
</p>
<p>11. By letters from the Registrar dated 13 April 2011, the General Counsel of 
IFAD and counsel for Ms Saez Garc&#237;a were informed that, in accordance with 
normal practice in such cases, the Court did not intend to hold public hearings. 
In the letter to the General Counsel of IFAD, the Registrar, on the instructions 
of the Court, also requested the former to transmit to him documents that were 
attached both to the complaint of Ms Saez Garc&#237;a submitted to the ILOAT on 
8 July 2008 and to IFAD&#8217;s Reply dated 12 September 2008, and which had not 
already been transmitted to the Court. The Registrar further requested the Gen-
eral Counsel to provide the Court with a copy of the employment contract of 
the Managing Director of the Global Mechanism of the UNCCD (hereinafter 
the &#8220;Global Mechanism&#8221;) for the years 2005 and 2006.
</p>
<p>12. By another letter dated 13 April 2011, on the instructions of the Court, the 
Registrar also requested that the General Counsel of IFAD duly provide to the 
Court, without any control being exercised over their content, any communica-
tions from Ms Saez Garc&#237;a relating to the request for an advisory opinion that 
she might wish to submit to it. In his letter to counsel for Ms Saez Garc&#237;a, men-
tioned in the previous paragraph, the Registrar reiterated that any further com-
munications directed to the Court were to be transmitted to it through IFAD.
</p>
<p>13. By a letter dated 6 May 2011, the General Counsel of IFAD communi-
cated to the Court a set of documents, attesting that those documents, combined 
with the documents which had been submitted by IFAD on 2 August 2010 (see 
paragraph 5 above), &#8220;comprise[d] the entire procedure before the Administra-
tive Tribunal of the International Labour Organization&#8221;. The employment con-
tract of the Managing Director of the Global Mechanism for the years 2005 and 
2006 was not transmitted as requested by the Court, the General Counsel stat-
ing in his letter that IFAD, as the housing entity of the Global Mechanism, was 
not authorized to disclose the employment contract of the latter&#8217;s Managing 
Director, and that even if IFAD had such authority, it could not disclose such a 
document without the authorization of the person concerned.
</p>
<p>14. By a letter of 28 June 2011 to the General Counsel of IFAD, the Regis-
trar indicated that, after an examination of the materials received relating to the 
procedure before the ILOAT, it appeared that 24 documents were still missing.

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>19  judgment no. 2867 of the ilo (advisory opinion)
</p>
<p>Under cover of a letter dated 7 July 2011, the General Counsel of IFAD pro-
vided these 24 documents.
</p>
<p>15. By a letter dated 20 July 2011, the Registrar informed the General Coun-
sel of IFAD that the Court, in application of its powers under Article 49 of its 
Statute, called upon the Fund to produce copies of the employment contract for 
the years 2005 and 2006 of the Managing Director of the Global Mechanism. 
Under cover of a letter dated 29 July 2011, the General Counsel of IFAD com-
municated to the Court that employment contract, as well as subsequent 
employment contracts of the Managing Director, accompanied by a letter from 
the Managing Director authorizing the disclosure of those employment con-
tracts for use by the Court. By this same letter, the General Counsel requested 
the Court to authorize IFAD to present additional observations and documents 
to the Court relating to those contracts.
</p>
<p>16. By letter dated 21 July 2011, on the instructions of the President, the Reg-
istrar communicated to the General Counsel of IFAD a question addressed by a 
Member of the Court to the Fund and, through it, to Ms Saez Garc&#237;a. By letters 
dated 26 August 2011, the General Counsel of IFAD communicated to the Court 
the response of the Fund to that question, transmitted to the Court the response 
of Ms Saez Garc&#237;a to that question and reiterated the Fund&#8217;s request that the 
Court hold oral proceedings in the case. Under cover of a letter also dated 
26 August 2011, the General Counsel of IFAD communicated to the Court a 
copy of Judgment No. 3003 of the ILOAT, delivered on 6 July 2011, whereby the 
Tribunal dismissed IFAD&#8217;s application for suspension of the execution of Judg-
ment No. 2867 pending the delivery of the advisory opinion of the Court.
</p>
<p>17. By a letter dated 1 September 2011, the General Counsel of IFAD requested 
the Court to authorize the Fund to produce other additional documents.
</p>
<p>18. By a letter dated 23 September 2011, the Registrar informed the General 
Counsel of IFAD that, with regard to the requests made on behalf of IFAD in 
his letter dated 9 March 2011 accompanying the written comments of the Fund 
(see paragraph 8 above) and in his letters dated 29 July 2011 (see paragraph 15 
above), 26 August 2011 (see paragraph 16 above), and 1 September 2011 (see 
paragraph 17 above), the Court had reconfirmed that no oral proceedings would 
be held, had decided that IFAD should not be authorized to present additional 
observations or documents to the Court, and had decided to make the written 
statements and comments, with annexed documents, accessible to the public, 
with immediate effect. Accordingly, under cover of letters dated 28 Septem-
ber 2011, electronic copies (on CD-ROM) of those documents were provided to 
all States and international organizations having been considered by the Court 
likely to be able to furnish information on the questions submitted to it. The 
written statements and comments (without annexes) were also placed on the 
website of the Court.

<p>I. The Court&#8217;s Jurisdiction
</p>
<p>19. The resolution of the Executive Board of IFAD requesting an 
advisory opinion in this case quotes Article XII of the Annex to the Stat-
</p>
<p>13</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>20  judgment no. 2867 of the ilo (advisory opinion)
</p>
<p>ute of the ILOAT and states that it &#8220;wishes to avail itself of the provi-
sions of the said Article&#8221;. That Article is in the following terms :
</p>
<p>&#8220;1. In any case in which the Executive Board of an international 
organization which has made the declaration specified in Article II, 
paragraph 5, of the Statute of the Tribunal challenges a decision of 
the Tribunal confirming its jurisdiction, or considers that a decision 
of the Tribunal is vitiated by a fundamental fault in the procedure 
followed, the question of the validity of the decision given by the 
Tribunal shall be submitted by the Executive Board concerned, for 
an advisory opinion, to the International Court of Justice.
</p>
<p>2. The opinion given by the Court shall be binding.&#8221;
</p>
<p>20. The Court recalls that, by a letter dated 4 October 1988, the Presi-
dent of IFAD informed the Director General of the International Labour 
Organization (hereinafter the &#8220;ILO&#8221;) that the Executive Board of IFAD 
had made the declaration required by Article II, paragraph 5, of the Stat-
ute of the Tribunal recognizing the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The Gov-
erning Body of the International Labour Office (the Office is the 
secretariat of the ILO) approved the declaration on 18 November 1988, 
and the Fund&#8217;s acceptance of jurisdiction took effect from 1 January 1989. 
</p>
<p>21. The Court first considers whether it has jurisdiction to reply to the 
request. While its jurisdiction was not challenged, the Court notes that 
Ms Saez Garc&#237;a contended that some of the questions posed by IFAD in 
its request do not fall within the scope of Article XII of the Annex to the 
Statute of the ILOAT. The Court observes that the power of the Execu-
tive Board to request an advisory opinion and the jurisdiction of the 
Court to give the opinion are founded on the Charter of the United 
Nations and the Statute of the Court and not on Article XII of the Annex 
to the Statute of the ILOAT alone. Under Article 65, paragraph 1, of its 
Statute,
</p>
<p>&#8220;[t]he Court may give an advisory opinion on any legal question at 
the request of whatever body may be authorized by or in accordance 
with the Charter of the United Nations to make such a request&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>The General Assembly and the Security Council are authorized by Arti-
cle 96, paragraph 1, of the Charter to request an advisory opinion on 
&#8220;any legal question&#8221; ; and, under Article 96, paragraph 2,
</p>
<p>&#8220;[o]ther organs of the United Nations and specialized agencies, which 
may at any time be so authorized by the General Assembly, may also 
request advisory opinions of the Court on legal questions arising 
within the scope of their activities&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>22. That is to say, the General Assembly is given a gatekeeping role. It 
is only in terms of its authorization, given under Article 96, paragraph 2, 
</p>
<p>14</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>21  judgment no. 2867 of the ilo (advisory opinion)
</p>
<p>that requests can be made by organs other than the Assembly itself and 
the Security Council, as the Court has already pointed out in its Advisory 
Opinion of 23 October 1956 (see <i>Judgments of the Administrative Tribunal 
of the ILO upon Complaints Made against Unesco, Advisory Opinion</i> (here-
inafter the &#8220;1956 Advisory Opinion&#8221;), <i>I.C.J. Reports 1956</i>, pp. 83-84 ; see 
also <i>Application for Review of Judgement No. 273 of the United Nations 
Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1982</i>, pp. 333-334, 
para. 21).
</p>
<p>23. The General Assembly, by resolution 32/107 of 15 December 1977, 
approved the Relationship Agreement between the United Nations and 
the International Fund for Agricultural Development (hereinafter the 
&#8220;Relationship Agreement&#8221;). Under Article I of the Relationship Agree-
ment, the United Nations recognized the Fund as a specialized agency in 
accordance with Articles 57 and 63 of the Charter and Article 8 of the 
Agreement of 13 June 1976 establishing IFAD (hereinafter the &#8220;Agree-
ment establishing IFAD&#8221;). In Article XIII, paragraph 2, of the Relation-
ship Agreement, the General Assembly authorized the Fund to request 
advisory opinions :  
</p>
<p>&#8220;The General Assembly of the United Nations authorizes the Fund 
to request advisory opinions of the International Court of Justice on 
legal questions arising within the scope of the Fund&#8217;s activities, other 
than questions concerning the mutual relationships of the Fund and 
the United Nations or other specialized agencies. Such requests may 
be addressed to the Court by the Governing Council of the Fund, or 
by its Executive Board acting pursuant to an authorization by the 
Governing Council. The Fund shall inform the Economic and Social 
Council of any such request it addresses to the Court.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>The Relationship Agreement came into force on 15 December 1977, the 
date of its approval by the General Assembly. The Court notes that the 
record before it does not include any communication from IFAD inform-
ing the Economic and Social Council of its request for an advisory opinion.
 
</p>
<p>24. On the following day, 16 December 1977, the Governing Council 
of the Fund, in exercise of the power conferred on it by Article 6, Sec-
tion 2 <i>(c)</i>, of the Agreement establishing IFAD, by resolution 77/2, &#8220;[a]utho-
rize[d] the Executive Board to exercise all the powers of the Council&#8221;, 
with the exception of certain specified powers and those reserved by the 
Agreement to the Council. That delegation was amended by Council reso-
lution 86/XVIII of 26 January 1995 with effect from 20 February 1997. 
The power to request advisory opinions was not excluded from the dele-
gation. No issue arises in respect of the delegation of that power by the 
Council to the Board.
</p>
<p>25. As already noted (see paragraph 19), the Executive Board of IFAD, 
in its resolution requesting an advisory opinion in this case, expresses its 
</p>
<p>15</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>22  judgment no. 2867 of the ilo (advisory opinion)
</p>
<p>wish to avail itself of Article XII of the Annex to the Statute of the 
ILOAT. While the resolution does not also refer to the authorization 
granted by the General Assembly under Article 96, paragraph 2, of the 
Charter, that authorization, as the Court has already stated, is a neces-
sary condition to the making of such a request. The Court takes the 
opportunity to emphasize that the ILO could not, when it adopted the 
Tribunal&#8217;s Statute, give its organs, or other institutions, the authority to 
challenge decisions of the Tribunal by way of a request for an advisory 
opinion.
</p>
<p>26. The terms of Article 96, paragraph 2, of the Charter, Article 65, 
paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Court and the authorization given to 
the Fund by Article XIII, paragraph 2, of the Relationship Agreement 
state certain requirements which are to be met if an opinion is to be 
requested. In terms of those requirements, the Fund&#8217;s request for review 
of a judgment concerning its hosting of the Global Mechanism and the 
question of whether it employed Ms Saez Garc&#237;a do present &#8220;legal ques-
tions&#8221; which &#8220;arise within the scope of the Fund&#8217;s activities&#8221;. The autho-
rization given to IFAD by Article XIII, paragraph 2, of the Relationship 
Agreement excludes &#8220;questions concerning the mutual relationships of 
the Fund and the United Nations or other specialized agencies&#8221;. That 
exclusion, which is included in all authorizations given by the General 
Assembly to specialized agencies, reflects the co-ordinating role of the 
Economic and Social Council under Chapter X of the Charter. That role 
was expressly mentioned by the General Assembly in the authorization it 
gave to the Council to request advisory opinions (resolution 89 (I) of 
11 December 1946). The exclusion does not prevent the Court from con-
sidering the relationships between the Fund and the Global Mechanism 
or the COP, which are not specialized agencies, so far as these relation-
ships are raised by the questions put to the Court by IFAD.  
</p>
<p>27. Accordingly, the Court concludes that, in terms of the relevant 
provisions of the Charter, the Statute of the Court and the authorization 
given under the Relationship Agreement, the Fund has the power to sub-
mit for an advisory opinion the question of the validity of the decision 
given by the ILOAT in its Judgment No. 2867 and that the Court has 
jurisdiction to consider the request for an advisory opinion. The scope of 
that jurisdiction is however subject to the effect in the present case of 
Article XII of the Annex to the Statute of the ILOAT, a matter to which 
the Court now turns.
</p>
<p>* *
</p>
<p>II. Scope of the Court&#8217;s Jurisdiction
</p>
<p>28. Under Article VI, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the ILOAT, the 
judgment of the Tribunal relating to a complaint brought by an official is 
</p>
<p>16</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>23  judgment no. 2867 of the ilo (advisory opinion)
</p>
<p>final and without appeal. However, pursuant to Article XII, paragraph 1, 
of the Statute of the ILOAT and Article XII, paragraph 1, of its Annex, 
respectively, the ILO and international organizations having made the 
declaration recognizing the jurisdiction of the ILOAT may nonetheless 
challenge the ILOAT judgment within the terms of these provisions. 
Under Article XII, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the ILOAT and of its 
Annex, the opinion of this Court given in terms of those provisions is 
&#8220;binding&#8221;. As the Court said in the 1956 Advisory Opinion, that effect 
goes beyond the scope attributed by the Charter and the Statute of the 
Court to an advisory opinion. It does not affect the way in which the 
Court functions ; that continues to be determined by its Statute and Rules 
(<i>I.C.J. Reports 1956</i>, p. 84 ; see also <i>Difference relating to Immunity from 
Legal Process of a Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human 
Rights, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1999 (I)</i>, pp. 76-77, paras. 24-25).
</p>
<p>29. The power of the Court to review a judgment of the ILOAT by 
reference to Article XII of the Annex to the Statute of the ILOAT at the 
request of the relevant specialized agency is limited to two grounds : that 
the Tribunal wrongly confirmed its jurisdiction or the decision is vitiated 
by a fundamental fault in the procedure followed. In the 1956 Advisory 
Opinion, the Court emphasized the limits of the first of these grounds :  
</p>
<p>&#8220;The circumstance that the Tribunal may have rightly or wrongly 
adjudicated on the merits or that it may have rightly or wrongly inter-
preted and applied the law for the purposes of determining the merits, 
in no way affects its jurisdiction. The latter is to be judged in the light 
of the answer to the question whether the complaint was one the 
merits of which fell to be determined by the Administrative Tribunal 
in accordance with the provisions governing its jurisdiction. That dis-
tinction between jurisdiction and merits is of great importance in the 
legal r&#233;gime of the Administrative Tribunal. Any mistakes which it 
may make with regard to its jurisdiction are capable of being cor-
rected by the Court on a Request for an Advisory Opinion emanating 
from the Executive Board. Errors of fact or of law on the part of the 
Administrative Tribunal in its Judgments on the merits cannot give 
rise to that procedure. The only provision which refers to its decisions 
on the merits is Article VI of the Statute of the Tribunal which pro-
vides that its judgments shall be &#8216;final and without appeal&#8217;.&#8221; 
(<i>I.C.J. Reports 1956</i>, p. 87.)
</p>
<p>The review, the Court said later in the same Opinion, is not in the nature 
of an appeal on the merits of the judgment ; the challenge cannot properly 
be transformed into a procedure against the manner in which jurisdiction 
has been exercised or against the substance of the decision (<i>ibid.</i>, 
pp. 98-99).
</p>
<p>30. The other ground for challenge &#8212; a fundamental fault in the pro-
cedure followed &#8212; concerns the procedure and not the substance of the 
judgment. When the Court was asked to review a judgment of the United 
</p>
<p>17</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>24  judgment no. 2867 of the ilo (advisory opinion)
</p>
<p>Nations Administrative Tribunal (hereinafter the &#8220;UNAT&#8221;) in 1973, 
where the grounds for review included &#8220;a fundamental error in procedure 
which ha[d] occasioned a failure of justice&#8221;, it stated that the essence of 
the concept,
</p>
<p>&#8220;in the cases before the Administrative Tribunal, may be found in the 
fundamental right of a staff member to present his case, either orally 
or in writing, and to have it considered by the Tribunal before it 
determines his rights. An error in procedure is fundamental and con-
stitutes &#8216;a failure of justice&#8217; when it is of such a kind as to violate the 
official&#8217;s right to a fair hearing . . . and in that sense to deprive him 
of justice. To put the matter in that way does not provide a complete 
answer to the problem of determining precisely what errors in pro-
cedure are covered by the words of Article 11. But certain elements of 
the right to a fair hearing are well recognized and provide criteria 
helpful in identifying fundamental errors in procedure which have 
occasioned a failure of justice : for instance, the right to an independ-
ent and impartial tribunal established by law ; the right to have the 
case heard and determined within a reasonable time ; the right to a 
reasonable opportunity to present the case to the tribunal and to 
comment upon the opponent&#8217;s case ; the right to equality in the pro-
ceedings vis-&#224;-vis the opponent ; and the right to a reasoned decision.&#8221; 
(<i>Application for Review of Judgement No. 158 of the United Nations 
Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1973</i>, p. 209, 
para. 92.)
</p>
<p>31. The Court observes at this stage that the procedural grounds in the 
two Statutes are stated differently. The ILOAT provision speaks of a 
decision &#8220;vitiated by a fundamental fault in the procedure followed&#8221; by 
the Tribunal while that in the UNAT Statute required a finding of &#8220;a 
fundamental error in procedure which has occasioned a failure of jus-
tice&#8221;. That difference in wording, however, does not &#8220;alter the scope of 
this ground of challenge&#8221; (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 209, para. 91). The Court returns to 
this ground which is invoked in Questions II-VIII later in this Opinion 
(see paragraph 98 below). 
</p>
<p>32. Having determined that it has jurisdiction to answer the present 
request for an advisory opinion and indicated in a preliminary way the 
limits on the scope of its power of review in terms of Article XII of the 
Annex to the Statute of the ILOAT, the Court now considers whether in 
exercise of its discretion there is reason to refuse to answer that request.
</p>
<p>* *
</p>
<p>III. The Court&#8217;s Discretion
</p>
<p>33. Article 65 of the Statute of the Court makes it clear that it has a 
discretion whether to reply to a request for an advisory opinion : &#8220;The 
</p>
<p>18</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>25  judgment no. 2867 of the ilo (advisory opinion)
</p>
<p>Court may give an advisory opinion on any legal question . . .&#8221; That dis-
cretion exists for good reasons. In exercising that discretion, the Court 
has to have regard to its character, both as a principal organ of the United 
Nations and as a judicial body. The Court early declared that the exercise 
of its advisory jurisdiction represents its participation in the activities of 
the Organization and, in principle, a request should not be refused (<i>Inter-
pretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, First 
Phase, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1950</i>, pp. 71-72). That indication 
of a strong inclination to reply is also reflected in the Court&#8217;s later state-
ment, in the only other challenge to a decision of the ILOAT brought to 
it, that &#8220;compelling reasons&#8221; would be required to justify a refusal (<i>Advi-
sory Opinion,</i> <i>I.C.J. Reports 1956</i>, p. 86).  
 
</p>
<p>34. The Court and its predecessor have emphasized that, in their advi-
sory jurisdiction, they must maintain their integrity as judicial bodies. 
The Permanent Court of International Justice as long ago as 1923, in 
recognizing that it had discretion to refuse a request, made an important 
statement of principle : 
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Court, being a Court of Justice, cannot, even in giving advi-
sory opinions, depart from the essential rules guiding [its] activity as 
a Court.&#8221; (<i>Status of Eastern Carelia, Advisory Opinion, 1923, P.C.I.J., 
Series B, No. 5</i>, p. 29 ; for the most recent statement on this matter 
see <i>Accordance with International Law of the Unilateral Declaration of 
Independence in Respect of Kosovo, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 
2010 (II)</i>, pp. 415-416, para. 29, and the authorities referred to there.)
 
</p>
<p>35. In the particular context of the four requests (i.e, the 1956 Advi-
sory Opinion ; <i>Application for Review of Judgement No. 158 of the United 
Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1973</i>, 
p. 166 ; <i>Application for Review of Judgement No. 273 of the United Nations 
Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1982</i>, p. 325 ; 
<i>Application for Review of Judgement No. 333 of the United Nations Admin-
istrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1987</i>, p. 18) brought 
to this Court by way of applications for review of judgments of the 
UNAT and the ILOAT, concerns have been raised about a central aspect 
of the good administration of justice : the principle of equality before the 
Court of the organization on the one hand and the official on the other. 
</p>
<p>36. Two issues arising from Article XII of the Tribunal&#8217;s Statute and 
its Annex providing for review of the ILOAT judgments were addressed 
by the Court in its 1956 Advisory Opinion : inequality of access to the 
Court and inequalities in the proceedings before the Court. With regard 
to the first point, it is only the employing agencies which have access to 
the Court. By contrast, the provisions for the review by the Court of 
judgments of the UNAT, in force from 1955 to 1995, gave officials, along 
with the employer and member States of the United Nations, access 
</p>
<p>19</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>26  judgment no. 2867 of the ilo (advisory opinion)
</p>
<p>to the process which could lead to a request to the Court for review. 
When that review procedure was being established, the Secretary-General 
i dentified as a fundamental principle that the staff member should have 
the right to initiate the review and to participate in it. Further, any review 
procedure should enable the staff member to participate on an equitable 
basis in such procedure, which should ensure substantial equality 
(UN doc. A/2909 of 10 June 1955, paras. 13 and 17).  
 
</p>
<p>37. In its 1956 Advisory Opinion, the Court said this about equality of 
access :
</p>
<p>&#8220;According to generally accepted practice, legal remedies against a 
judgment are equally open to either party. In this respect each  possesses 
equal rights for the submission of its case to the tribunal called upon 
to examine the matter . . . However, the advisory proceedings which 
have been instituted in the present case involve a certain absence of 
equality between Unesco and the officials both in the origin and in the 
progress of those proceedings . . . [T]he Executive Board availed itself 
of a legal remedy which was open to it alone. Officials have no such 
remedy against the Judgments of the Administrative Tribunal . . . 
However, the inequality thus stated does not in fact constitute an 
ine quality before the Court. It is antecedent to the examination of the 
question by the Court. It does not affect the manner in which the Court 
undertakes that examination. Also, in the present case, that absence 
of equality between the parties to the Judgments is somewhat nominal 
since the officials were successful in the proceedings before the Admin-
istrative Tribunal and there was accordingly no question of any com-
plaint on their part.&#8221; (<i>I.C.J. Reports 1956</i>, p. 85.)
</p>
<p>38. After considering inequality before the Court, it concluded that not 
to respond to the request for an advisory opinion &#8220;would imperil the 
working of the r&#233;gime established by the Statute of the Administrative 
Tribunal for the judicial protection of officials&#8221; (ibid., p. 86). The Court, 
addressing this matter 50 years later, has two observations to make, 
one particular, about the use actually made of the review processes in 
respect of the two Tribunals &#8212; that of the United Nations and that of the 
ILO &#8212;, and one general, about the development of the concept of 
e quality before courts and tribunals over that period. On the review pro-
cess, the critical element for the judicial protection of officials was the 
creation of the right of officials to challenge decisions taken against them 
by their employer before an independent judicial body which follows fair 
p rocedures. Next, reviews have been sought in only a handful of cases ; 
and when the G eneral Assembly decided in 1995 to remove the provision 
for review of UNAT decisions by this Court, it stated that the procedure 
that had existed since 1955 had &#8220;not proved to be a constructive or useful 
element in the adjudication of staff disputes within the Organization&#8221; 
(resolution 50/54 of 11 December 1995, preamble). The Court also notes

<p>that between 1995 and 2009 the United Nations system contained no 
p rovision at all for review of, or appeal against, the judgments of the 
UNAT.  
 
</p>
<p>39. To turn to the general question of the concept of equality, the 
development of the principle of equality of access to courts and tribunals 
since 1946, when the review procedure was established, may be seen in the 
significant differences between the two General Comments by the Human 
Rights Committee on Article 14, paragraph 1, of the International 
 Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 1966. That provision requires 
that &#8220;[a]ll persons shall be equal before the courts and tribunals&#8221;. The 
first Comment, adopted in 1984, just seven years after the Covenant came 
into force, did no more than repeat the terms of the provision and call 
on States to report more fully on steps taken to ensure equality before 
the courts, including equal access to the courts (<i>Human Rights Commit-
tee, General Comment No. 13 : Article 14 (Administration of Justice)</i>, 
paras. 2-3). The later Comment, one adopted in 2007 on the basis of 
30 years of experience in the application of the above-mentioned Article 
14, gives detailed attention to equality before domestic courts and tribu-
nals. According to the Committee, that right to equality guarantees equal 
access and equality of arms. While in non-criminal matters the right of 
equal access does not address the issue of the right of appeal, if proce-
dural rights are accorded they must be provided to all the parties unless 
distinctions can be justified on objective and reasonable grounds (Human 
<i>Rights Committee, General Comment No. 32 : Right to Equality before 
Courts and Tribunals and to a Fair Trial</i>, paras. 8-9, 12 and 13). In the 
case of the ILOAT, the Court is unable to see any such justification for 
the provision for review of the Tribunal&#8217;s decisions which favours the 
employer to the disadvantage of the staff member.  
</p>
<p>40. The Fund and Ms Saez Garc&#237;a answered a question from a Mem-
ber of the Court (see paragraph 16 above) about the significance, if any, 
of the developments relating to the equality of the parties before courts 
and tribunals since 1946. In her response, Ms Saez Garc&#237;a calls attention 
to the relevant guarantees included in global and regional instruments 
over those 65 years and their further elaboration by international and 
national courts. She sets out how, in her view, the present proceedings 
illustrate the contradiction between the procedure set out in Article XII 
of the Annex to the Statute of the ILOAT and more modern concepts of 
the equality of arms. She contrasts, on the one hand, the application 
which the Fund made to the Tribunal for the suspension of the execution 
of the judgment, an application which was rejected on the ground that the 
Tribunal had no power to do so (see paragraph 16 above), and, on the 
other hand, the power of the newly established United Nations Appeals 
Tribunal to order interim measures for the protection of either party. The 
lack of such a power, in her view, provides a compelling reason for this 
</p>
<p>21</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>28  judgment no. 2867 of the ilo (advisory opinion)
</p>
<p>Court to refuse to exercise its advisory jurisdiction to review judgments of 
the ILOAT. Ms Saez Garc&#237;a also refers to problems, as she sees it, in the 
equality of the parties in the present proceedings before the Court, con-
sidered later in this Opinion (see paragraphs 45-46). She concludes, in the 
light of the developments relating to the requirement of equality in the 
administration of justice and the abolition of the review of UNAT judg-
ments, that &#8220;the many defects that the Court has remarked upon in the 
review procedure constitute a compelling reason to reject the . . . request 
for an advisory opinion&#8221;.  
 
</p>
<p>41. In its Reply, IFAD for its part first emphasizes that &#8220;the sole func-
tion&#8221; of Article XII of the Annex to the Statute of the ILOAT, when a 
specialized agency is invoking it, is to interpret the agreement between the 
ILO and that specialized agency ; the questions submitted to the Court, it 
maintains, &#8220;deal exclusively with the application and the interpretation of 
the agreement between the ILO and IFAD in the context of Article XII&#8221;. 
Individuals, says the Fund, stand outside the institutional relationship 
that forms the subject-matter of Article XII procedures. It concludes this 
part of its answer in the following terms :  
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Fund respectfully submits that, given that the Complainant 
in ILOAT Judgment No. 2867 is not a party to the agreement between 
the ILO and the Fund, which accords jurisdiction to the ILOAT, it 
would be a mistake to consider that the inability of third parties to 
invoke Article 96, paragraph 2, of the UN Charter in order to apply 
Article XII of the ILOAT Statute constitutes a breach of the principle 
of equality of the parties in judicial proceedings. Accordingly, it 
would not be appropriate for the Court to decline to perform the 
function envisaged by Article 96, paragraph 2, of the UN Charter on 
account of a third party that stands outside the relationship that 
forms the subject-matter of the proceedings before the Court.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>Further, IFAD states that 
</p>
<p>&#8220;the Fund&#8217;s request for an advisory opinion pertains, not to any dis-
pute between the Fund and Ms Saez Garc&#237;a, but to the relationship 
between the Fund and the ILO as it relates to the ILOAT, a subsid-
iary body of the ILO&#8221;.
</p>
<p>42. In the Court&#8217;s opinion, this argument faces two insurmountable 
hurdles. In the first place, the real dispute underlying the request for an 
advisory opinion was between Ms Saez Garc&#237;a and the Fund. She brought 
proceedings before the Tribunal against a decision attributed to the Fund 
and was successful. The Fund then invoked the procedure under the Stat-
ute of the ILOAT, supported by the General Assembly&#8217;s authorization 
given under Article 96, paragraph 2, of the Charter, to challenge that 
</p>
<p>22</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>29  judgment no. 2867 of the ilo (advisory opinion)
</p>
<p>decision in her favour. In that regard, the Court cannot see that a ques-
tion arises between the Fund and the ILO. The record before the Court 
provides no evidence of any such matter. In the second place, the Fund in 
any event would not be able to bring a matter about its relationship with 
the ILO before the Court : when the General Assembly authorized IFAD 
to seek advisory opinions, under Article 96, paragraph 2, of the Charter, 
it expressly excluded from the authorization &#8220;questions concerning the 
mutual relationships of the Fund and the United Nations or other 
 specialized agencies&#8221; ; a similar exclusion is to be found in all the authori-
zations given by the General Assembly to specialized agencies (see para-
graph 26 above).  
</p>
<p>43. In replying to the question about equality of access, the Fund 
emphasized what it saw as a parallel with investor-State arbitration. First, 
it pointed out that in such arbitrations, it is only the investor that may 
initiate the dispute settlement process. But that process is initiated in 
response to the conduct of the host State, alleged to be in breach of the 
investor&#8217;s rights, and is a first instance process. It is comparable to the 
proceeding brought in the ILOAT by the staff member against the agency. 
In the case of investment arbitrations brought under the Convention on 
the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of 
Other States (<i>United Nations Treaty Series (UNTS)</i>, Vol. 575, p. 159), 
both parties &#8212; and not just one &#8212; are able to seek interpretation, revi-
sion or annulment of the award : it is that situation which is analogous to 
the present one. The Fund, secondly, refers to a number of provisions in 
bilateral free trade and investment treaties which enable the State parties 
to those treaties, by joint decision, at the request of one of them, to 
declare their interpretation of a provision of the treaty. That interpreta-
tion is binding on the tribunal hearing an investment dispute including 
those brought by the investor. That situation bears little resemblance to 
the present one : parties to treaties are in general free to agree on their 
interpretation, while in the present case the Court is concerned with the 
initiation of a review process to be carried out by an independent tribu-
nal.  
 
</p>
<p>44. As the Court said, on the only other occasion in which a special-
ized agency sought an opinion in terms of Article XII of the Annex to the 
Statute of the ILOAT, &#8220;[t]he principle of equality of the parties follows 
from the requirements of good administration of justice&#8221; (<i>Advisory 
 Opinion,</i> <i>I.C.J Reports 1956</i>, p. 86). That principle must now be under-
stood as including access on an equal basis to available appellate or simi-
lar remedies unless an exception can be justified on objective and 
reasonable grounds (see paragraph 39 above). For the reasons given, 
questions may now properly be asked whether the system established in 
1946 meets the present-day principle of equality of access to courts and 
tribunals. While the Court is not in a position to reform this system, it 
</p>
<p>23</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>30  judgment no. 2867 of the ilo (advisory opinion)
</p>
<p>can attempt to ensure, so far as possible, that there is equality in the pro-
ceedings before it. The Court now turns to that question.  
</p>
<p>45. In the present case, as in the four earlier applications for review of 
judgments of administrative tribunals, the unequal position before the 
Court of the employing institution and its official, arising from provisions 
of the Court&#8217;s Statute, has been substantially alleviated by two decisions 
of the Court. First, in its Order of 29 April 2010, the Court decided that 
the President of the Fund was to transmit to the Court any statement set-
ting forth the views of Ms Saez Garc&#237;a which she might wish to bring to 
the attention of the Court and fixed the same time-limits for her as for the 
Fund for the filing of written statements in the first round of written argu-
ment and comments in the second round. The second step the Court took 
was to decide that there would be no oral proceedings ; when the Fund 
reiterated its request that the Court should hold hearings, it confirmed its 
previous decision of principle. As has been clear since 1956 when the 
Court first addressed the matter of procedure in cases involving reviews 
of judgments of administrative tribunals, the Court&#8217;s Statute does not 
allow individuals to appear in hearings in such cases, by contrast to inter-
national organizations concerned (<i>Advisory Opinion, I.C.J Reports 1956</i>, 
p. 86 ; see also <i>Application for Review of Judgement No. 158 of the United 
Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1973</i>, 
pp. 179-180, para. 34).  
</p>
<p>46. The process was not without its difficulties. The Court mentions 
three matters. The first relates to the documentary record : the filing of &#8220;all 
documents likely to throw light upon the question&#8221; in terms of Article 65, 
paragraph 2, of the Court&#8217;s Statute was not completed until July 2011 and 
following three requests from the Court &#8212; that is, fully 15 months after the 
submission of the request for the Advisory Opinion (see paragraphs 13-15 
above). The second is the failure of IFAD to inform Ms Saez Garc&#237;a in a 
timely way of the procedural requests it was making to the Court. And the 
third is IFAD&#8217;s initial failure to transmit to the Court certain communica-
tions from Ms Saez Garc&#237;a. That last position was based on the proposi-
tion that the matter before the Court was not a matter between the Fund 
and Ms Saez Garc&#237;a but between the Fund and the ILO. The Court has 
already commented on this proposition (see paragraphs 41-42 above).
</p>
<p>47. Notwithstanding these difficulties, the Court concludes that, by the 
end of the process, it does have the information it requires to decide on 
the questions submitted ; that both the Fund and Ms Saez Garc&#237;a have 
had adequate and in large measure equal opportunities to present their 
case and to answer that made by the other ; and that, in essence, the prin-
ciple of equality in the proceedings before the Court, required by its 
inherent judicial character and by the good administration of justice, has 
been met.

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>31  judgment no. 2867 of the ilo (advisory opinion)
</p>
<p>48. In light of the analysis above, the Court maintains its concern 
about the inequality of access to the Court arising from the review pro-
cess under Article XII of the Annex to the Statute of the ILOAT. In addi-
tion, the Court remains concerned about the length of time it took the 
Fund to comply with the procedures aimed at ensuring equality in the 
present proceedings. Nevertheless, taking the circumstances of the case as 
a whole, and in particular the steps it has taken to reduce the inequality 
in the proceedings before it, the Court considers that the reasons that 
could lead it to decline to give an advisory opinion are not sufficiently 
compelling to require it to do so.
</p>
<p>* *
</p>
<p>IV. Merits
</p>
<p>49. The request for an advisory opinion from the Court concerns the 
validity of the judgment given by the ILOAT relating to Ms Saez Gar-
c&#237;a&#8217;s contract of employment. The Court notes that that contract of 
employment, as extended, was governed by the Personnel Policies Man-
ual (hereinafter &#8220;PPM&#8221;) and the Human Resources Handbook, until 
22 July 2005. From that date, the PPM and Human Resources Hand-
book were replaced by a document entitled &#8220;IFAD Human Resources 
Policy&#8221; and the Human Resources Procedures Manual (hereinafter 
&#8220;HRPM&#8221;), respectively. Accordingly, subsequent events, such as the 
facilitation process and the convening of the Joint Appeals Board referred 
to in paragraphs 70 and 77 below, were governed by the latter documents. 
The Court will refer hereinafter to the titles of the documents in force at 
the time of events being considered.  
</p>
<p>50. In December 2005, a decision was made not to renew Ms Saez Gar-
c&#237;a&#8217;s contract of employment as from March 2006 on the alleged basis 
that her post was being abolished. She challenged that decision by filing 
an appeal with the Joint Appeals Board of the Fund (hereinafter the 
&#8220;JAB&#8221;) under the HRPM. On 13 December 2007 the JAB unanimously 
recommended that Ms Saez Garc&#237;a be reinstated and that she be awarded 
a payment of lost salaries, allowances and entitlements. On 4 April 2008 
the President of the Fund rejected the recommendations. Ms Saez Garc&#237;a 
then filed on 8 July 2008 a complaint with the Tribunal requesting it to 
&#8220;quash the decision of the President of IFAD rejecting the complainant&#8217;s 
appeal&#8221;, order her reinstatement and make various monetary awards. 
Following two rounds of written submissions (oral hearings were not 
sought), the Tribunal, in its judgment of 3 February 2010, decided that 
&#8220;[t]he President&#8217;s decision of 4 April 2008 is set aside&#8221; and made orders 
for the payment of damages and costs.  
 
</p>
<p>25</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>32  judgment no. 2867 of the ilo (advisory opinion)
</p>
<p>51. The Fund contends, as it did before the Tribunal, that Ms Saez Gar-
c&#237;a was a staff member of the Global Mechanism and not of IFAD and 
that her employment status has to be assessed in the context of the 
arrangement for the housing of the Global Mechanism made between the 
Fund and the COP.
</p>
<p>The Court first considers the powers of, and relationships between, 
those various bodies. It will then turn to the documents relating specifi-
cally to Ms Saez Garc&#237;a&#8217;s employment.  
</p>
<p>52. Part III of the UNCCD, which came into force in 1996, is entitled 
&#8220;Action Programmes, Scientific and Technical Co-operation and Sup-
porting Measures&#8221; and contains three sections addressed to each of those 
matters. The section on &#8220;Supporting Measures&#8221; imposes obligations on 
the State parties to the Convention relating to capacity building, financial 
resources and financial mechanisms (Arts. 19-21). Under Article 21, para-
graph 4, a &#8220;Global Mechanism&#8221; is established &#8220;[i]n order to increase the 
effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms&#8221;. It is &#8220;to 
promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substan-
tial financial resources . . . to affected developing country Parties&#8221;. It is to 
function under the authority and guidance of the COP and to be account-
able to it. Under paragraph 5, the COP was to identify, at its first ordi-
nary session, an organization to house the Global Mechanism. 
Paragraph 6 provides this elaboration : the COP was to make appropriate 
arrangements with the housing organization &#8220;for the administrative oper-
ations of such Mechanism, drawing to the extent possible on existing 
budgetary and human resources&#8221;. According to paragraph 5, the COP 
was to agree with the organization upon modalities to ensure, among 
other things, that the mechanism <i>(a)</i> prepares an inventory of co-opera-
tion programmes that are available to implement the UNCCD, <i>(b)</i> pro-
vides advice, on request, to parties on innovative methods of financing 
and related matters, <i>(c)</i> provides interested parties and organizations 
with information on sources of funds and funding patterns to facilitate 
co-ordination between them, and <i>(d)</i> reports to the COP on its activities.
  
 
</p>
<p>Before the Court sets out the terms of the agreement between the COP 
and IFAD, it refers to relevant provisions of the Convention concerning 
the COP and its Permanent Secretariat. 
</p>
<p>53. Part IV of the Convention, entitled &#8220;Institutions&#8221;, follows immedi-
ately the provisions of Article 21 which have just been discussed. It pro-
vides for the establishment of the COP, a Permanent Secretariat (replacing 
an interim Secretariat established by United Nations General Assembly 
resolution 47/188 of 22 December 1992 and referred to in Article 35 of the 
UNCCD) and a Committee on Science and Technology as a subsidiary 
body of the COP (Arts. 22, 23 and 24). The Conference&#8217;s powers include 
the power to establish subsidiary bodies, to approve a programme and a 
</p>
<p>26</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>33  judgment no. 2867 of the ilo (advisory opinion)
</p>
<p>budget, and to make arrangements, at its first session, for a Permanent 
Secretariat (Art. 22, paras. 2 <i>(c)</i> and <i>(g)</i>, and Art. 23, para. 3). The Per-
manent Secretariat&#8217;s functions include : to enter, under the guidance of 
the Conference of the Parties, into such administrative and contractual 
arrangements as may be required for the effective discharge of its func-
tions (Art. 23, para. 2 <i>(e)</i>).  
 
</p>
<p>54. So far as the arrangement for the housing of the Global Mecha-
nism is concerned, the COP, at its first session, held in 1997, decided to 
select IFAD for that purpose. In 1999 the Conference and the Fund 
signed a &#8220;Memorandum of Understanding . . . regarding the Modalities 
and Administrative Operations of the Global Mechanism&#8221; (hereinafter 
the &#8220;MOU&#8221;). The MOU provides, under Section II A, that &#8220;[w]hile the 
Global Mechanism will have a separate identity within the Fund, it will 
be an organic part of the structure of the Fund directly under the Presi-
dent of the Fund&#8221;. It also provides, under Section II D, that the Manag-
ing Director of the Global Mechanism shall be nominated by the 
Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme and 
appointed by the President of the Fund and that, in discharging his or her 
responsibilities, the Managing Director shall report directly to the Presi-
dent of IFAD. Under paragraph (1) of Section III A, headed &#8220;Relation-
ship of the Global Mechanism to the Conference&#8221;, the Global Mechanism 
functions under the authority of the COP and is fully accountable to it. 
Under paragraph (2) of the same section, the chain of accountability runs 
directly from the Managing Director to the President of the Fund to the 
COP, and the Managing Director submits reports to the COP on behalf 
of the President of the Fund. Under Section III A, paragraph (4), the 
Global Mechanism&#8217;s work programme and budget, including proposed 
staffing, are prepared by the Managing Director, reviewed and approved 
by the Fund&#8217;s President and forwarded to the Executive Secretary of the 
Convention for consideration in the preparation of the budget estimates 
of the Convention. Under Section II B, the resources of the Global 
 Mechanism are held by the Fund in various accounts. Under Section IV B, 
the Managing Director, on behalf of the President, submits reports on 
the Global Mechanism&#8217;s activities to each ordinary session of the COP. 
The Fund and Convention Secretariat are to co-operate in various ways. 
The final substantive provision of the MOU, Section VI, entitled &#8220;Admin-
istrative Infrastructure&#8221;, provides that the Global Mechanism shall be 
located at the headquarters of the Fund in Rome where it &#8220;shall enjoy full 
access to all of the administrative infrastructure available to the Fund 
offices, including appropriate office space, as well as personnel, financial, 
communications and information management services&#8221;. The terms of 
that provision reflect those of paragraph 6 of Article 21 of the UNCCD 
set out above (see paragraph 52 above).  
 
</p>
<p>27</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>34  judgment no. 2867 of the ilo (advisory opinion)
</p>
<p>55. For its Permanent Secretariat, the COP made an arrangement with 
the United Nations. The General Assembly approved the institutional 
linkage between the Secretariat of the Convention and the United Nations 
in accordance with the offer made by the Secretary-General and accepted 
by the COP (General Assembly resolution 52/198 of 18 December 1997 
and COP decision No. 3/COP.1). Under the arrangement, the Secretariat 
functions under the authority of the Secretary-General as chief adminis-
trative officer of the organization (UN doc. A/52/549 of 11 Novem-
ber 1997, para. 25). While institutionally linked to the United Nations, 
the Secretariat is not fully integrated in the work programme and man-
agement structure of any particular department or programme (<i>ibid.</i>, 
para. 26 ; COP decision No. 3/COP.1 and General Assembly resolu-
tion 52/198 of 18 December 1997, eighth preambular paragraph).  
</p>
<p>56. The General Assembly also noted that the COP had decided to 
accept the offer of the Government of Germany to host the Convention 
Secretariat in Bonn (General Assembly resolution 52/198 of 18 Decem-
ber 1997, para. 3). In 1998, the Secretariat of the Convention, the Gov-
ernment of the Federal Republic of Germany and the United Nations 
concluded an Agreement concerning the Headquarters of the Conven-
tion&#8217;s Permanent Secretariat (<i>UNTS</i>, Vol. 2029, p. 316). Under the Agree-
ment, the Convention Secretariat possesses, in the host country, the legal 
capacity to contract, to acquire and dispose of movable and immovable 
property, and to institute legal proceedings (<i>ibid.</i>, Art. 4 ; see also Arts. 3 
and 4 of the Agreement between the United Nations and the Federal 
Republic of Germany relating to the Headquarters of the United Nations 
Volunteers Programme, 10 November 1995 (<i>UNTS</i>, Vol. 1895, p. 103), 
which is applicable, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, to the Permanent Secretariat).
</p>
<p>57. The Court observes that, under Part IV of the Convention entitled 
&#8220;Institutions&#8221;, the COP and the Permanent Secretariat are expressly estab-
lished as such. These institutions are given the following powers : in the case 
of the COP, it is given the power to &#8220;make appropriate arrangements&#8221; to 
house the Global Mechanism, to &#8220;undertake necessary arrangements&#8221; for 
the financing of its subsidiary bodies and to &#8220;make arrangements&#8221; for the 
functioning of the Permanent Secretariat (Arts. 21 (6), 22 (2) <i>(g)</i> and 23 (3), 
respectively) ; in the case of the Permanent Secretariat, it is given the gen-
eral power &#8220;to enter, under the guidance of the Conference of the Parties, 
into such administrative and contractual arrangements as may be required 
for the effective discharge of its functions&#8221; (Art. 23 (2) (e)).  
</p>
<p>As the above account indicates, both have exercised those powers. By 
contrast, the Global Mechanism is not included in Part IV of the Conven-
tion. It is not given any express powers of contracting or entering into 
any agreement by the Convention nor by a headquarters agreement such 
as that relating to the Permanent Secretariat. Moreover, the record before 
the Court does not include any instances of it entering into contracts or 
agreements. IFAD, on 14 May 2010, during the period when the first

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>35  judgment no. 2867 of the ilo (advisory opinion)
</p>
<p>round of written statements was being prepared, wrote to the Managing 
Director of the Global Mechanism seeking information on that matter in 
the following terms :
</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to help us prepare our submission to the ICJ, IFAD 
kindly requests that your Office supply a comprehensive list of all 
agreements and legal documents signed between the Global Mecha-
nism and other entities, including international organizations and 
private entities. We intend to provide this list as part of our submis-
sion to the ICJ in order to show that the GM is recognized as having 
the capacity to enter into agreements.&#8221; (UN doc. ICCD/COP(10)/
INF.3 of 11 August 2011, p. 30.)  
</p>
<p>The written statement of IFAD submitted five months later includes no 
such list.
</p>
<p>58. The position of the Global Mechanism may also be contrasted 
with that of IFAD, its housing body. The Agreement establishing IFAD 
expressly provides that &#8220;[t]he Fund shall possess international legal per-
sonality&#8221; (Art. 10, Sec. 1). Its privileges and immunities are defined by 
reference to the Convention on the Privileges and the Immunities of the 
Specialized Agencies of 21 November 1947 (Art. 10, Sec. 2, of the Agree-
ment establishing IFAD). Under Article II, Section 3, of that Conven-
tion, specialized agencies subject to it, which include IFAD, are given the 
express capacity to contract, to acquire and dispose of movable and 
immovable property, and to institute legal proceedings in those States, 
including Italy, which are parties to the Convention.
</p>
<p>59. The Court recalls a point made by the Fund in its response to a 
question put by a Member of the Court to IFAD &#8212; and through it to 
Ms Saez Garc&#237;a. According to the Fund, should the Court decline to pro-
vide an advisory opinion, it would forsake the opportunity to &#8220;assist the 
international community by clarifying how the rules concerning the 
ILOAT&#8217;s jurisdiction should operate in respect of entities hosted by inter-
national organizations&#8221;. The Fund contends that this phenomenon of 
&#8220;hosting&#8221; arrangements is &#8220;one of the most significant developments 
since the adoption of Article XII of the ILOAT Statute in 1946&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>60. The Court is aware that there exists a range of hosting arrange-
ments between international organizations which are concluded for a 
variety of reasons. Each arrangement is distinct and has different charac-
teristics. There are hosting arrangements between two entities having 
separate legal personalities, and there are others concluded for the benefit 
of an entity without legal personality. An example of the former is the 
arrangement between the World Intellectual Property Organization &#8212; as 
the hosting organization &#8212; and the International Union for the Protec-
tion of New Varieties of Plants &#8212; as the hosted organization &#8212; which 
has legal personality under Article 24, paragraph 1, of its constituent 
instrument, the International Convention for the Protection of New Vari-
eties of Plants of 2 December 1961.

</p>
<p>61. By contrast, with regard to the Global Mechanism, the Court notes 
that the Convention directs the COP to identify an organization to house 
it and to make appropriate arrangements with such an organization for 
its administrative operations. It was for this reason that a Memorandum 
of Understanding was concluded between the COP and IFAD in 1999 as 
described in paragraph 54 above. Neither the Convention nor the MOU 
expressly confer legal personality on the Global Mechanism or otherwise 
endow it with the capacity to enter into legal arrangements. Further, in 
light of the different instruments setting up IFAD, the COP, the Global 
Mechanism and the Permanent Secretariat, and of the practice included 
in the record before the Court, the Global Mechanism had no power and 
has not purported to exercise any power to enter into contracts, agree-
ments or &#8220;arrangements&#8221;, internationally or nationally.  
 
 
</p>
<p>*
</p>
<p><i>A. Response to Question I
</i></p>
<p>62. The Court now turns to the questions put to it for an advisory 
opinion and notes that such questions should be asked in neutral terms 
rather than assuming conclusions of law that are in dispute. They should 
not include reasoning or argument. The questions asked in this case 
depart from that standard as reflected in normal practice. The Court will 
nevertheless address them.
</p>
<p>63. The first question put to the Court is formulated as follows :
&#8220;Was the ILOAT competent, under Article II of its Statute, to hear 
</p>
<p>the complaint introduced against the International Fund for Agricul-
tural Development (hereby the Fund) on 8 July 2008 by Ms A. T. S. G., 
an individual who was a member of the staff of the Global Mechanism 
of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in 
Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertifica-
tion, Particularly in Africa (hereby the Convention) for which the 
Fund acts merely as housing organization?&#8221;  
</p>
<p>64. The Court is requested to give its opinion on the competence of the 
ILOAT to hear the complaint brought against the Fund by Ms Saez Gar-
c&#237;a on 8 July 2008. The competence of the Tribunal regarding complaints 
filed by staff members of organizations other than the ILO is based on 
Article II, paragraph 5, of its Statute, according to which 
</p>
<p>&#8220;[t]he Tribunal shall also be competent to hear complaints alleging 
non-observance, in substance or in form, of the terms of appointment 
of officials and of provisions of the Staff Regulations of any other 
international organization meeting the standards set out in the Annex&#8221;
</p>
<p>30</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>37  judgment no. 2867 of the ilo (advisory opinion)
</p>
<p>to the Statute of the ILOAT and having made a declaration recognizing 
the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.
</p>
<p>65. The Fund recognized the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and accepted 
its Rules of Procedure with effect from 1 January 1989 (see paragraph 20 
above). However, as implied in the formulation of its first question to the 
Court, the Fund considers Ms Saez Garc&#237;a
</p>
<p>&#8220;a member of the staff of the Global Mechanism of the United 
Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries 
Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in 
Africa (hereby the Convention) for which the Fund acts merely as 
housing organization&#8221;.
</p>
<p>The Fund therefore objected to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal with 
respect to the complaint filed by Ms Saez Garc&#237;a, and in particular her 
pleas alleging that the Managing Director of the Global Mechanism 
exceeded his authority in deciding not to renew her contract and that the 
approved core budget of the Global Mechanism did not require the elim-
ination of her post.
</p>
<p>66. Before the Tribunal, the Fund contended that its acceptance of the 
jurisdiction of the ILOAT did not extend to entities that are hosted by it 
pursuant to international agreements. It maintained that the Global 
Mechanism was not an organ of the Fund, and that, even if the Fund 
administered the Global Mechanism, this did not make the Complainant 
a staff member of the Fund ; nor did it make the actions of the Managing 
Director of the Global Mechanism attributable to the Fund. According 
to the Fund, despite the fact that the staff regulations, rules and policies 
of IFAD were applied to the Complainant, she was not a staff member of 
the Fund. Conversely, the Complainant submitted that she was a staff 
member of IFAD throughout the relevant period until her separation on 
15 March 2006, and that her letters of appointment and renewal of con-
tract all offered her an appointment with the Fund.
</p>
<p>67. In its Judgment No. 2867 of 3 February 2010, the Tribunal rejected 
the jurisdictional objections made by the Fund and declared itself compe-
tent to entertain all the pleas set out in the complaint submitted by 
Ms Saez Garc&#237;a. After examining the Fund&#8217;s argument that the Tribunal 
did not have jurisdiction because the Fund and the Global Mechanism 
had separate legal identities, the Tribunal observed that :  
</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that the Global Mechanism is an integral part of the 
Convention and is accountable to the Conference does not necessitate 
the conclusion that it has its own legal identity . . . Nor does the 
stipulation in the MOU that the Global Mechanism is to have a &#8216;sep-
arate identity&#8217; indicate that it has a separate legal identity, or more 
precisely for present purposes, that it has separate legal personality.&#8221; 
(Judgment No. 2867, p. 11, para. 6.)  
</p>
<p>31</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>38  judgment no. 2867 of the ilo (advisory opinion)
</p>
<p>The Tribunal then referred to the provisions of the MOU, and stated 
that :
</p>
<p>&#8220;[I]t is clear that the words &#8216;an organic part of the structure of the 
Fund&#8217; indicate that the Global Mechanism is to be assimilated to the 
various administrative units of the Fund for all administrative pur-
poses. The effect of this is that administrative decisions taken by the 
Managing Director in relation to staff in the Global Mechanism are, 
in law, decisions of the Fund.&#8221; (Judgment No. 2867, p. 12, para. 7.) 
 
</p>
<p>Following this analysis, the Tribunal concluded as follows :
&#8220;Given that the personnel of the Global Mechanism are staff mem-
</p>
<p>bers of the Fund and that the decisions of the Managing Director 
relating to them are, in law, decisions of the Fund, adverse adminis-
trative decisions affecting them are subject to internal review and 
appeal in the same way and on the same grounds as are decisions 
relating to other staff members of the Fund. So too, they may be the 
subject of a complaint to this Tribunal in the same way and on the 
same grounds as decisions relating to other staff members.&#8221; (Ibid., 
p. 14, para. 11.) 
</p>
<p>68. It is this confirmation by the Tribunal of its &#8220;competence to hear&#8221; 
the complaint filed by Ms Saez Garc&#237;a that is challenged by the Executive 
Board of the Fund, under Article XII of the Annex to the Statute of the 
ILOAT and is the object of the first question put to the Court as repro-
duced in paragraph 63 above. To answer this question, the Court has to 
consider whether the Tribunal had the competence to hear the complaint 
submitted by Ms Saez Garc&#237;a in accordance with Article II, paragraph 5, 
of its Statute. According to this provision, for the Tribunal to exercise its 
jurisdiction it is necessary that there should be a complaint alleging 
non-observance of the &#8220;terms of appointment of officials&#8221; of an organiza-
tion that has accepted its jurisdiction or &#8220;of provisions of the Staff Regu-
lations&#8221; of such an organization. It follows from this that the Tribunal 
could hear the complaint only if the complainant was an official of an 
organization that has recognized the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, and if 
the complaint related to the non-observance of the terms of appointment 
of such an official or the provisions of the staff regulations of the organi-
zation. The first set of conditions has to be examined with reference to the 
competence <i>ratione personae</i> of the Tribunal, while the second has to be 
considered within the context of its competence <i>ratione materiae</i>.
</p>
<p>69. The Court will examine these two sets of conditions below. How-
ever, before doing so, a brief overview of the factual background to the 
case decided by the Tribunal is warranted.
</p>
<p><i>1. Factual background
</i></p>
<p>70. Ms Saez Garc&#237;a, a national of Venezuela, was offered by IFAD on 
1 March 2000 a two-year fixed-term contract at P-4 level to serve as a 
</p>
<p>32</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>39  judgment no. 2867 of the ilo (advisory opinion)
</p>
<p>Programme Officer in the Global Mechanism. She accepted this offer on 
17 March 2000. Subsequently, her contract was twice extended, to 
15 March 2004 and 15 March 2006, respectively. In addition, her title 
changed to &#8220;Programme Manager, Latin America Region&#8221;, from 
22 March 2002, and is subsequently referred to, in the notice of 
non-renewal of her contract from the Managing Director of the Global 
Mechanism, as &#8220;[P]rogramme [M]anager for GM&#8217;s regional desk for 
Latin America and the Caribbean&#8221;. By a memorandum of 15 Decem-
ber 2005, the Managing Director of the Global Mechanism informed her 
that the COP had decided to cut the Global Mechanism&#8217;s budget for 
2006-2007 by 15 per cent. As a result, the number of staff paid through 
the core budget had to be reduced. Her post would therefore be abolished 
and her contract would not be renewed upon expiry on 15 March 2006. 
He offered her a six-month contract as consultant from 26 March to 
15 September 2006 as &#8220;an attempt to relocate her and find a suitable 
alternative employment&#8221;. Ms Saez Garc&#237;a did not accept that contract.  
</p>
<p>On 10 May 2006, Ms Saez Garc&#237;a requested a facilitation process, 
which ended with no settlement on 22 May 2007. She then filed an appeal 
with the JAB on 27 June 2007, challenging the Managing Director&#8217;s deci-
sion of 15 December 2005. In its report of 13 December 2007, the JAB 
unanimously recommended that Ms Saez Garc&#237;a be reinstated within the 
Global Mechanism under a two-year fixed-term contract and that the 
Global Mechanism pay her an amount equivalent to all the salaries, 
allowances and entitlements she had lost since March 2006.  
 
</p>
<p>By a memorandum of 4 April 2008, the President of the Fund informed 
Ms Saez Garc&#237;a that he had decided to reject the recommendations of the 
JAB. It is this decision of the President of the Fund that was impugned 
before ILOAT and set aside by it (see paragraph 50 above).  
</p>
<p><i>2. Jurisdiction </i>ratione personae<i> of the Tribunal in relation to the complaint 
submitted by Ms Saez Garc&#237;a
</i></p>
<p>71. Since recourse to the ILOAT is open to staff members of IFAD, 
the Court will now consider whether Ms Saez Garc&#237;a was an official of 
the Fund, or of some other entity that did not recognize the jurisdiction 
of the Tribunal. The Court notes that the word &#8220;official&#8221;, used in the ILO 
Staff Regulations, as well as in the Statute of the Tribunal, and the words 
&#8220;staff member&#8221;, used in the staff regulations and rules of many other 
organizations, may be considered to have the same meaning in the pres-
ent context ; the Court thus will use both terms interchangeably. The 
document entitled &#8220;IFAD Human Resources Policy&#8221; defines a staff mem-
ber as &#8220;a person or persons holding a regular, career, fixed-term, tempo-
rary or indefinite contract with the Fund&#8221;. To qualify as a staff member 
</p>
<p>33</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>40  judgment no. 2867 of the ilo (advisory opinion)
</p>
<p>of the Fund, Ms Saez Garc&#237;a would have to hold one of the above-men-
tioned contracts with the Fund.  
 
</p>
<p>72. The Court notes that on 1 March 2000, Ms Saez Garc&#237;a received an 
offer of employment, written on the Fund letterhead, for &#8220;a fixed-term 
appointment for a period of two years with the International Fund for 
Agricultural Development (IFAD)&#8221;. The letter stated that the appoint-
ment &#8220;[would] be made in accordance with the general provisions of the 
IFAD Personnel Policies Manual . . . [and] with such Administrative 
Instructions as may be issued . . . regarding the application of the 
 Manual&#8221;. The offer of appointment also noted that her contract might be 
terminated by IFAD with one month&#8217;s written notice and that she was 
subject to a probationary period as prescribed in Section 4.8.2 of the PPM. 
Moreover, under the terms of the offer, she was required to give written 
notice of at least one month to IFAD of any desire to terminate her con-
tract. The renewals of her contract to March 2004 and to March 2006, 
respectively, referred to an &#8220;extension of [her] appointment with the Inter-
national Fund for Agricultural Development&#8221;. It was also said in the let-
ters of renewal that all other conditions of her employment would remain 
unchanged and that her appointment would &#8220;continue to be governed by 
the Personnel Policies Manual, together with the provisions of the Human 
Resources Handbook regarding the application of the Manual&#8221;.
</p>
<p>73. The above-mentioned facts are not contested by the Fund. In its 
written statement to the Court, the Fund makes the following observa-
tions :
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is true that the offer and extension letters in the case of the 
Complainant were all issued on IFAD letterhead by IFAD officials 
and all of them refer to an &#8216;appointment with the International Fund 
for Agricultural Development&#8217;. The initial offer letter dated 
1 March 2000, which was signed by the Director of the Fund&#8217;s Per-
sonnel Division, also stated that the Complainant&#8217;s &#8216;employment may 
be terminated by IFAD&#8217; and that she &#8216;will be required to give written 
notice of at least one month to IFAD&#8217; should she wish to terminate 
her employment during the probationary period. While the two exten-
sion letters are silent on termination and resignation, both state that 
&#8216;[a]ll other conditions of employment will remain unchanged&#8217;.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>74. Notwithstanding the above, the Fund maintains that Ms Saez Gar-
c&#237;a was not an IFAD official, but a staff member of the Global Mecha-
nism which has not recognized the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. In this 
connection, it refers to the fact that the 1 March 2000 contract also con-
tained the following statement : 
</p>
<p>&#8220;The position you are being offered is that of Programme Officer 
in the Global Mechanism of the Convention to Combat Desertifica-
</p>
<p>34</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>41  judgment no. 2867 of the ilo (advisory opinion)
</p>
<p>tion, Office of the President (OP), in which capacity you would be 
responsible to the Managing Director of the Global Mechanism.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>It also argues that, throughout her employment with the Global Mecha-
nism, Ms Saez Garc&#237;a &#8220;was never charged with performing any of the 
functions of the Fund, nor had she been employed by the Fund or per-
formed functions for the Fund prior to being employed by the Global 
Mechanism&#8221;. Moreover, the Fund contends that IFAD and the Global 
Mechanism are separate legal entities, and that the Tribunal should have 
taken into account the consequences of this separation for its jurisdiction 
with respect to the complaint filed by Ms Saez Garc&#237;a.  
</p>
<p>75. Ms Saez Garc&#237;a submits that she was a staff member of the Fund 
and that the staff regulations and rules of the Fund applied to her. She 
further contends that the Managing Director of the Global Mechanism 
was an officer of the Fund and that his actions were, in law, the actions 
of the Fund.
</p>
<p>76. The Court observes that a contract of employment entered into 
between an individual and an international organization is a source of rights 
and duties for the parties to it. In this context, the Court notes that the offer 
of appointment accepted by Ms Saez Garc&#237;a on 17 March 2000 was made 
on behalf of the Fund by the Director of its Personnel Division, and that the 
subsequent renewals of this contract were signed by personnel officers of the 
same Division of the Fund. The Fund does not question the authority vested 
in these officials to act on its behalf on personnel matters. These offers were 
made in accordance with the general provisions of the PPM, which then 
contained the general conditions and terms of employment with the Fund, 
as well as the respective duties and obligations of the Fund and the staff. As 
the Court stated in its 1956 Advisory Opinion, staff regulations and rules of 
the organization in question &#8220;constitute the legal basis on which the inter-
pretation of the contract must rest&#8221; (<i>I.C.J. Reports 1956</i>, p. 94). It follows 
from this that an employment relationship, based on the above-mentioned 
contractual and statutory elements, was established between Ms Saez Gar-
c&#237;a and the Fund. This relationship qualified her as a staff member of the 
Fund. The fact that she was assigned to perform functions related to the 
mandate of the Global Mechanism does not mean that she could not be a 
staff member of the Fund. The one does not exclude the other. In this con-
text, reference may also be made to the fact that IFAD included Ms Saez Gar-
c&#237;a&#8217;s name on the list of IFAD officials for whom the Organization claimed 
privileges and immunities in the host country in accordance with the Con-
vention on the Privileges and Immunities of the Specialized Agencies.
</p>
<p>77. Ms Saez Garc&#237;a&#8217;s legal relationship with the Fund as a staff mem-
ber is further evidenced by the facts surrounding her appeal against the 
decision to abolish the post of Programme Manager for the Global 
Mechanism&#8217;s regional desk for Latin America and the Caribbean, and the 
consequent non-renewal of her fixed-term appointment. Her appeals were 
</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>42  judgment no. 2867 of the ilo (advisory opinion)
</p>
<p>initially lodged with the internal machinery established by the Fund for 
handling staff grievances, namely the facilitation process and the JAB. 
The record before the Court includes no evidence that the Fund objected 
to the use of these procedures by Ms Saez Garc&#237;a. The facilitation process 
was conducted by a facilitator appointed by the IFAD administration 
and in accordance with Chapter 10 of the HRPM. That process was ter-
minated in accordance with paragraph 10.21.1 <i>(b)</i> of the HRPM. Simi-
larly, the JAB was convened under the terms of the HRPM and its report 
and recommendations were submitted to the President of IFAD for con-
sideration in accordance with the procedures established by Chapter 10 
(Sec. 10.38) of the HRPM. In a memorandum dated 4 April 2008, the 
President of IFAD rejected the recommendations of the JAB to reinstate 
Ms Saez Garc&#237;a to a position in the Global Mechanism with a two-year 
fixed-term contract from the date of reinstatement. However, the Presi-
dent&#8217;s memorandum does not contain any indication that Ms Saez Gar-
c&#237;a was not a staff member of the Fund. On the contrary, it is stated in the 
memorandum that &#8220;the non-renewal of your fixed-term contract was in 
accordance with Section 1.21.1 of the IFAD HRPM&#8221;. There is also noth-
ing to suggest that, in rejecting the recommendation of the JAB, the Pres-
ident was acting otherwise than in his capacity as the President of IFAD.
  
 
 
</p>
<p>78. The Court turns now to the other arguments submitted by the 
Fund to support its contention that Ms Saez Garc&#237;a was not a staff mem-
ber of the Fund. First, the Fund refers to an administrative instruction 
issued by IFAD in the form of a President&#8217;s Bulletin on 21 January 2004 
which, according to the Fund, was meant &#8220;to refine and clarify the legal 
position of the personnel working for the Global Mechanism&#8221;, and 
quotes paragraph 11 <i>(c)</i> of the Bulletin in which it is stated that :
</p>
<p>&#8220;IFAD&#8217;s rules and regulations on the provision of career contracts 
for fixed-term staff shall not apply to the staff of the Global Mecha-
nism, except for those that have already received a career contract as 
a result of their earlier employment with IFAD&#8221;.
</p>
<p>For the Fund, this stipulation makes clear that &#8220;while Global Mecha-
nism staff are not IFAD staff, some of IFAD&#8217;s rules and regulations 
apply mutatis mutandis to Global Mechanism staff&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>Secondly, the Fund asserts that, although the Tribunal acknowledged 
that IFAD took the position that &#8220;neither the COP nor the GM has rec-
ognized the jurisdiction of the Tribunal&#8221;, it did not address this point 
explicitly in its ruling and proceeded to exercise jurisdiction. Therefore, 
the Fund invites the Court to take note of the fact that neither the Global 
Mechanism nor the COP has recognized the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, 
and that consequently the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>36</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>43  judgment no. 2867 of the ilo (advisory opinion)
</p>
<p>Thirdly, the Fund argues that the Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to 
review the decision not to renew Ms Saez Garc&#237;a&#8217;s contract which was 
taken by the Managing Director of the Global Mechanism as he was not 
&#8220;a member of IFAD&#8217;s staff in his dealings with the Complainant&#8221;. Accord-
ing to the Fund, the Tribunal had, therefore, no jurisdiction to examine 
the decision of the Managing Director to abolish the post of Ms Saez Gar-
c&#237;a or the budgetary reasons underlying that decision.  
</p>
<p>79. The Court first notes that staff members of the Global Mechanism 
are not eligible, under the terms of the IFAD President&#8217;s Bulletin men-
tioned above, for career appointments under the staff regulations and 
rules of the Fund. This does not however put them outside the purview of 
such provisions, nor deprive them of the possibility of being appointed on 
the basis of renewable fixed-term contracts. In this connection, the Court 
recalls that the complaint filed by Ms Saez Garc&#237;a with the ILOAT was 
not about the alleged failure of IFAD to grant her a career contract, but 
about the non-renewal of her fixed-term contract. The Court also recalls 
that paragraph 10 of the same Bulletin provides that :  
</p>
<p>&#8220;As a matter of principle and where there is an absence of a specific 
provision to the contrary, as specified below, the Global Mechanism 
shall be subject to all provisions of IFAD&#8217;s Personnel Policies Manual 
(PPM) and Human Resources Handbook (HRH), as they may be 
amended.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It is the Court&#8217;s view that the provisions of the IFAD President&#8217;s Bul-
letin constitute further evidence of the applicability of the staff regula-
tions and rules of IFAD to the fixed-term contracts of Ms Saez Garc&#237;a, 
and provide additional indication of the existence of an employment rela-
tionship between her and the Fund.
</p>
<p>80. The Court next takes note of the fact that, as underlined by the 
Fund and based on the record before it, neither the COP nor the Global 
Mechanism has accepted the jurisdiction of the ILOAT. The Tribunal did 
not however base its jurisdiction with respect to the complaint filed by 
Ms Saez Garc&#237;a on such acceptance. The judgment rendered by the Tri-
bunal shows that it decided to exercise its jurisdiction after having con-
cluded that Ms Saez Garc&#237;a and other staff members of the Global 
Mechanism were staff members of the Fund and, as such, were entitled to 
submit complaints to the Tribunal in the same way and on the same 
grounds as other staff members of the Fund.
</p>
<p>81. Finally, with respect to the Fund&#8217;s contention that the Managing 
Director of the Global Mechanism was not a staff member of IFAD, the 
Court considers that the status of the Managing Director has no rele-
vance to the Tribunal&#8217;s jurisdiction <i>ratione personae</i>, which depends solely 
on the status of Ms Saez Garc&#237;a. The Court will examine the status of the 
Managing Director, rather, in its treatment of the Tribunal&#8217;s jurisdiction 
<i>ratione materiae</i> below.
</p>
<p>37</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>44  judgment no. 2867 of the ilo (advisory opinion)
</p>
<p>82. In light of the above, the Court concludes that the Tribunal was 
competent <i>ratione personae</i> to consider the complaint brought by 
Ms Saez Garc&#237;a against IFAD on 8 July 2008.
</p>
<p><i>3. Jurisdiction </i>ratione materiae<i> of the Tribunal
</i></p>
<p>83. As a staff member of the Fund, Ms Saez Garc&#237;a had the right to 
submit her complaint to the ILOAT. The HRPM provides in Sec-
tion 10.40.1 as follows :
</p>
<p>&#8220;Staff members have the right to appeal to the ILOAT, under the 
procedures prescribed in its Statute and Rules, against : (a) final deci-
sions taken by the President ; and <i>(b)</i> after the expiration of the 
period prescribed in para. 10.39.2 above, the failure of the President 
to take a final decision.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>84. The Fund, however, argues that, even if it were to be assumed that 
the Tribunal had jurisdiction <i>ratione personae</i> over the Complainant 
because of her being a staff member of the Fund, the Tribunal would still 
not have jurisdiction <i>ratione materiae</i> over the complaint. The Fund 
emphasizes that, under the terms of Article II, paragraph 5, of the Statute 
of the ILOAT, there are only two classes of complaints that the Tribunal 
is competent to hear, namely : (1) complaints alleging &#8220;non-observance, in 
substance or form, of the terms of appointment of officials&#8221; ; and (2) com-
plaints alleging non-observance &#8220;of provisions of the Staff Regulations&#8221;. 
The Fund argues that, based on the text of the Complainant&#8217;s pleadings 
submitted to the Tribunal, it is clearly not possible to fit her complaints 
under the two classes of complaints set forth in Article II, paragraph 5, of 
the Tribunal&#8217;s Statute. It asserts that the Complainant&#8217;s case was placed 
entirely on a different basis, namely, paragraphs 4 and 6 of Section III A 
of the MOU, which the Complainant used to argue, first, that the Manag-
ing Director exceeded his authority in deciding not to renew her contract 
and, secondly, that the &#8220;core budget&#8221; approved by the Conference did 
not require the abolition of her post. The reliance by the Complainant on 
these provisions of the MOU was acknowledged and described by the 
Tribunal in paragraph 4 of its judgment (p. 10). The Fund further argues 
that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to entertain these submissions, which 
did not contain allegations of non-observance of IFAD staff regulations 
and rules, and erred by nonetheless proceeding to adjudicate the Com-
plainant&#8217;s claims on this basis. 
</p>
<p>85. The Fund also contends that the Tribunal was not competent to 
entertain the Complainant&#8217;s arguments as derived from the MOU, the 
UNCCD or the COP&#8217;s decisions, as these are outside the scope of 
 Article II, paragraph 5, of the Tribunal&#8217;s Statute. According to the Fund, 
the Tribunal, in reaching its conclusions, examined the internal decision- 
making process established by the Convention, even though neither the 
COP nor any other organ or agent of the Convention is subject to the 
Tribunal&#8217;s jurisdiction. Thus, for the Fund, the Tribunal treated the 
</p>
<p>38</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>45  judgment no. 2867 of the ilo (advisory opinion)
</p>
<p> dispute as one concerning the interpretation and application of the MOU 
and the COP&#8217;s decisions, instead of as a dispute concerning the interpre-
tation and application of the staff regulations and rules of the defendant 
Organization. In IFAD&#8217;s view, given that the Tribunal chose this treat-
ment, it was not justified in confirming its jurisdiction and therefore its 
decision is invalid.
</p>
<p>86. Ms Saez Garc&#237;a asserts that the large number of jurisdictional 
questions raised by the Fund in its request for an advisory opinion sug-
gest that it is indeed going beyond the rulings on jurisdiction made by the 
Tribunal, to question either the manner in which the Tribunal has exer-
cised its jurisdiction or the breadth of its considerations in hearing the 
complaint.
</p>
<p>87. The Court reiterates that the decision impugned before the Admin-
istrative Tribunal was that of the President of IFAD contained in a memo-
randum to Ms Saez Garc&#237;a dated 4 April 2008 in which he rejected the 
recommendations of the JAB to reinstate Ms Saez Garc&#237;a. The JAB 
unanimously found that :
</p>
<p>&#8220;the Managing Director&#8217;s decision not to renew the Appellant&#8217;s 
fixed-term contract was beyond his authority and contrary to the rules 
and spirit of the HRPM. In addition, no evidence was presented or 
found to support the Respondent&#8217;s claim that the decision was made 
in consultation with IFAD&#8217;s Management, specifically the President 
who is ultimately responsible for the GM.&#8221; (JAB, Recommendations, 
para. 31.)  
 
</p>
<p>In the notice of non-renewal of Ms Saez Garc&#237;a&#8217;s contract dated 
15 December 2005, the Managing Director of the Global Mechanism 
informed her that due to the decrease in the core budget of the Global 
Mechanism, it was decided to abolish the post of Programme Manager 
for the Global Mechanism&#8217;s regional desk for Latin America and the 
Caribbean, which she had hitherto occupied. Ms Saez Garc&#237;a challenged, 
among other things, the decision of the Managing Director, in her com-
plaint to the Tribunal, and alleged that it was tainted with abuse of 
authority and that he was not entitled to determine the Global Mecha-
nism&#8217;s programme of work independently of the COP and of the Presi-
dent of IFAD. The Fund objected to the Tribunal&#8217;s competence to 
examine these allegations since they would involve the examination by 
the Tribunal of the decision-making process of the Global Mechanism for 
which it had no jurisdiction. The Tribunal rejected these objections on the 
ground that &#8220;decisions of the Managing Director relating to [staff in the 
Global Mechanism] are, in law, decisions of the Fund&#8221;.
</p>
<p>88. The Court cannot agree with the arguments of the Fund that the 
Tribunal did not have competence to examine the decision of the Manag-
ing Director of the Global Mechanism. First, the Managing Director of 
the Global Mechanism was a staff member of the Fund when the decision 
</p>
<p>39</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>46  judgment no. 2867 of the ilo (advisory opinion)
</p>
<p>of non-renewal of Ms Saez Garc&#237;a&#8217;s contract was taken. The letter of 
appointment of the Managing Director of the Global Mechanism, which 
was signed by the President of the Fund on 13 January 2005, provides that 
the Managing Director was offered &#8220;a fixed-term appointment for a period 
of two years with the International Fund for Agricultural Development 
(IFAD)&#8221;. In this capacity he was to be &#8220;directly responsible to the Presi-
dent of IFAD&#8221;. His appointment was &#8220;governed by the general provisions 
of the IFAD Personnel Policies Manual . . . together with the provisions 
of the Human Resources Handbook&#8221;. The Managing Director was 
appointed at the D-2 level and provided with a copy of IFAD&#8217;s Informa-
tion Circular IC/PE/03/11, which described the various components of 
salaries, allowances and other benefits &#8220;to which IFAD staff members in 
the professional category and above are entitled&#8221;. In addition, the Manag-
ing Director was required to participate in the Fund&#8217;s medical insurance 
schemes. Moreover, the report of the JAB concerning the appeal of 
Ms Saez Garc&#237;a, while showing the Managing Director as the respondent, 
indicates that he acted as such on behalf of IFAD, following designation 
by the IFAD President. Thus, the record before the Court clearly indicates 
that the Managing Director of the Global Mechanism, in his capacity as 
an IFAD official, acted on behalf of IFAD at the time the decision was 
taken not to renew the fixed-term contract of Ms Saez Garc&#237;a.
</p>
<p>89. Secondly, the allegation by Ms Saez Garc&#237;a in her complaint to the 
Tribunal, according to which the non-renewal of her appointment was 
not based on valid reasons, or that it suffered from other substantive or 
procedural flaws, falls within the category of allegations of non-obser-
vance of the &#8220;terms of appointment of an official&#8221; as specified in Arti-
cle II, paragraph 5, of the Statute of the Tribunal. As was emphasized by 
the Court in its 1956 Advisory Opinion :
</p>
<p>&#8220;there is a relationship, a legal relationship, between the renewal and 
the original appointment and, consequently, between the renewal and 
the legal position of an official at the moment when his claim to 
renewal is granted or denied . . . Thus the complainant, in claiming 
to possess a right to renewal of his contract and in claiming that that 
right had been infringed, was placing himself on the ground of 
non-observance of the terms of appointment.&#8221; (<i>I.C.J. Reports 1956</i>, 
p. 94.)
</p>
<p>90. Thirdly, the letters of appointment and renewal of contract of 
Ms Saez Garc&#237;a clearly stipulate that her appointment was made in accor-
dance with the general provisions of the PPM and any amendments 
thereto, as well as such administrative instructions as may be issued from 
time to time regarding the application of the Manual. The non-obser-
vance of the provisions of these instruments, or those adopted subse-
quently to replace them (see paragraph 49 above), could be impugned 
before the Tribunal in accordance with Article II, paragraph 5, of its Stat-
ute. In this connection, the Court observes that Ms Saez Garc&#237;a alleged 
violations of the HRPM before the Tribunal, notably violations of Sec-
</p>
<p>40</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>47  judgment no. 2867 of the ilo (advisory opinion)
</p>
<p>tions 1.21.1 and 11.3.9 <i>(b)</i> (Judgment No. 2867, p. 4, para. B). Moreover, 
the fact that the President of IFAD stated, in his memorandum rejecting 
the JAB recommendations, that the non-renewal of her contract &#8220;was in 
accordance with the Human Resources Procedures Manual (HRPM), 
Section 1.21.1&#8221; is further evidence of the link between her complaint to 
the Tribunal and the staff regulations and rules of the Fund.  
 
</p>
<p>91. The Court, therefore, concludes that Ms Saez Garc&#237;a&#8217;s complaint 
to the ILOAT, following the decision of the Fund not to renew her con-
tract, falls within the scope of allegations of non-observance of her terms 
of appointment and of the provisions of the staff regulations and rules of 
the Fund, as prescribed by Article II, paragraph 5, of the Statute of the 
Tribunal. Consequently, the Court is of the view that the Tribunal was 
competent <i>ratione materiae</i> to consider the complaint brought before it 
by Ms Saez Garc&#237;a in respect of the non-renewal of her contract by 
IFAD.
</p>
<p>92. With regard to the Fund&#8217;s contention that the Tribunal lacked 
jurisdiction to examine the provisions of the MOU and the decision- 
making process of the COP in reaching its key decisions, as those matters 
are outside the scope of Article II, paragraph 5, of its Statute, the Court 
notes that the Tribunal first examined the MOU, as a preliminary ques-
tion regarding its jurisdiction in the context of the arguments of the parties, 
and in connection with the extent to which it could legally review the 
decision of the Managing Director of the Global Mechanism. In this con-
text, the Tribunal stated that the arguments of the Parties &#8220;[went] to the 
powers and jurisdiction of the Tribunal and, on that account, must be 
dealt with even though raised for the first time in [the] proceedings [before 
the Tribunal]&#8221; (Judgment No. 2867, p. 9, para. 1). The Tribunal then ana-
lysed various provisions of the MOU, in particular paragraphs 4 and 6 of 
Section III A, which deal with the accountability of the Global Mecha-
nism and its Managing Director to the COP.  
 
</p>
<p>93. The Court accepts that these matters are not directly related to the 
provisions of the staff regulations and rules of IFAD, the alleged 
non-observance of which confers jurisdiction on the Tribunal to hear 
complaints from the Fund&#8217;s staff members. The Court, however, recog-
nizes their relevance for the Tribunal&#8217;s determination of its own jurisdic-
tion in a case in which the Complainant&#8217;s status as a staff member of the 
Fund was contested by the Fund itself on the basis of the arrangements 
made between the COP and IFAD. In this context, the Court recalls that 
the Fund, in its written submissions to the Tribunal in response to the 
complaint filed by Ms Saez Garc&#237;a, contended that the Fund and the 
Global Mechanism were separate legal entities, and that the acts of the 
Global Mechanism or those of its Managing Director were not attribut-
able to IFAD. Moreover, the Fund challenged the competence of the Tri-
</p>
<p>41</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>48  judgment no. 2867 of the ilo (advisory opinion)
</p>
<p>bunal to review alleged flaws in the decision-making of the Global 
Mechanism and its Managing Director, since neither the COP nor the 
Global Mechanism had accepted the jurisdiction of the ILOAT. In these 
circumstances, the Court is of the opinion that the Tribunal could not 
avoid determining whether it had jurisdiction to hear the complaint, and 
examining the legal arrangements governing the relationship between the 
Global Mechanism and the Fund, as well as the status and accountability 
of the Managing Director of the Global Mechanism.  
</p>
<p>94. In light of the above, it is not necessary for the Court to give 
detailed consideration to the arguments put forward by the Fund, in its 
submissions to the Tribunal and to the Court, that the Tribunal lacked 
jurisdiction to entertain the complaint because the Fund and the Global 
Mechanism were separate legal entities, and the latter had never accepted 
the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Even if, contrary to the observation that 
the Court has made in paragraph 61 above, the Global Mechanism did 
have a separate legal personality and the capacity to conclude contracts, 
the conclusions arrived at above would still be warranted, essentially on 
the basis of the contractual documents examined and the provisions of 
the IFAD staff regulations and rules.  
</p>
<p>95. The Court, therefore, finds, in response to the first question put to 
it by IFAD, that the ILOAT was competent to hear the complaint intro-
duced against IFAD, in accordance with Article II of its Statute, in view 
of the fact that Ms Saez Garc&#237;a was a staff member of the Fund, and her 
appointment was governed by the provisions of the staff regulations and 
rules of the Fund.
</p>
<p>*
</p>
<p><i>B. Response to Questions II to VIII
</i></p>
<p>96. The Court, having decided to give an affirmative answer to the first 
question, and having concluded that the Tribunal was justified in confirm-
ing its jurisdiction, is of the view that its answer to the first question put to 
it by the Fund covers also all the issues on jurisdiction raised by the Fund 
in Questions II to VIII of its request for an advisory opinion from the 
Court. In addition to the issues of jurisdiction, two sets of other issues are 
raised in these questions. First, Questions II to VIII are framed in such a 
manner as to seek the opinion of the Court on the reasoning underlying the 
conclusions reached by the Tribunal either on its jurisdiction or on the mer-
its of the complaint brought before it. Secondly, they contain references to 
the possible existence of a fundamental fault in the procedure followed by 
the Tribunal. The Court will briefly address these two sets of issues.
</p>
<p>97. The Court reiterates that, under the terms of Article XII of the Annex 
to the Statute of the ILOAT, a request for an advisory opinion seeking 
review of a judgment of the Tribunal is limited to cases where a decision of 
</p>
<p>42</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>49  judgment no. 2867 of the ilo (advisory opinion)
</p>
<p>the Tribunal confirming its jurisdiction is challenged or where a fundamen-
tal fault in the procedure is alleged (see paragraph 29 above). The Court has 
already addressed the IFAD Executive Board&#8217;s challenge to the decision of 
the Tribunal confirming its jurisdiction. Not having a power of review with 
regard to the reasoning of the Tribunal or the merits of its judgments under 
Article XII of the Annex to the Statute of the ILOAT, the Court cannot give 
its opinion on those matters. As the Court observed in its 1956 Advisory 
Opinion, &#8220;the reasons given by the Tribunal for its decision on the merits, 
after it confirmed its jurisdiction, cannot properly form the basis of a chal-
lenge to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal&#8221; (<i>I.C.J. Reports 1956</i>, p. 99). 
</p>
<p>98. Regarding the &#8220;fundamental fault in the procedure followed&#8221;, the 
Court recalls that this concept was explained by the Court in its Advisory 
Opinion of 1973 on the <i>Application for Review of Judgement No. 158 of 
the United Nations Administrative Tribunal</i> as set out in paragraphs 30 to 
31 above.
</p>
<p>Questions II to VIII of IFAD do not identify any fundamental fault in 
the procedure which may have been committed by the Tribunal in its 
consideration of the complaint against the Fund. Neither the information 
made available to the Court by the Fund, nor an analysis of the judgment 
of the Tribunal, demonstrate a fundamental fault in its procedure. Thus, 
in the view of the Court, these questions constitute either a repetition of 
the question on jurisdiction, which the Court has already answered, or 
have an object which concerns wider issues falling outside the scope of 
Article XII of the Annex to the Statute of the ILOAT which was invoked 
by the Fund as the basis of its request for an advisory opinion.
</p>
<p>*
</p>
<p><i>C. Response to Question IX
</i></p>
<p>99. Question IX put by the IFAD Executive Board in its request for an 
advisory opinion is formulated as follows : &#8220;What is the validity of the 
decision given by the ILOAT in its Judgment No. 2867 ?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Court, having answered in the affirmative the first question of 
IFAD, and having therefore decided that the Tribunal was entirely justi-
fied in confirming its jurisdiction, and not having found any fundamental 
fault in the procedure committed by the Tribunal, finds that the decision 
given by the ILOAT in its Judgment No. 2867 is valid.
</p>

<p>The Court,
</p>
<p>(1) Unanimously,
</p>
<p><i>Finds</i> that it has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested ;
